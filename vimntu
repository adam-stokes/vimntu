  =head1 NAME
  
  Clone::PP - Recursively copy Perl datatypes
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use Clone::PP qw(clone);
    
    $item = { 'foo' => 'bar', 'move' => [ 'zig', 'zag' ]  };
    $copy = clone( $item );
  
    $item = [ 'alpha', 'beta', { 'gamma' => 'vlissides' } ];
    $copy = clone( $item );
  
    $item = Foo->new();
    $copy = clone( $item );
  
  Or as an object method:
  
    require Clone::PP;
    push @Foo::ISA, 'Clone::PP';
    
    $item = Foo->new();
    $copy = $item->clone();
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides a general-purpose clone function to make deep
  copies of Perl data structures. It calls itself recursively to copy
  nested hash, array, scalar and reference types, including tied
  variables and objects.
  
  The clone() function takes a scalar argument to copy. To duplicate
  arrays or hashes, pass them in by reference:
  
    my $copy = clone(\@array);    my @copy = @{ clone(\@array) };
    my $copy = clone(\%hash);     my %copy = %{ clone(\%hash) };
  
  The clone() function also accepts an optional second parameter that
  can be used to limit the depth of the copy. If you pass a limit of
  0, clone will return the same value you supplied; for a limit of
  1, a shallow copy is constructed; for a limit of 2, two layers of
  copying are done, and so on.
  
    my $shallow_copy = clone( $item, 1 );
  
  To allow objects to intervene in the way they are copied, the
  clone() function checks for a couple of optional methods. If an
  object provides a method named C<clone_self>, it is called and the
  result returned without further processing. Alternately, if an
  object provides a method named C<clone_init>, it is called on the
  copied object before it is returned.
  
  =head1 BUGS
  
  Some data types, such as globs, regexes, and code refs, are always copied shallowly.
  
  References to hash elements are not properly duplicated. (This is why two tests in t/dclone.t that are marked "todo".) For example, the following test should succeed but does not:
  
    my $hash = { foo => 1 }; 
    $hash->{bar} = \{ $hash->{foo} }; 
    my $copy = clone( \%hash ); 
    $hash->{foo} = 2; 
    $copy->{foo} = 2; 
    ok( $hash->{bar} == $copy->{bar} );

  =head1 NAME
  
  Data::Printer - colored pretty-print of Perl data structures and objects
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  Want to see what's inside a variable in a complete, colored
  and human-friendly way?
  
    use Data::Printer;   # or just "use DDP" for short
    
    p @array;            # no need to pass references
  
  Code above might output something like this (with colors!):
  
     [
         [0] "a",
         [1] "b",
         [2] undef,
         [3] "c",
     ]
  
  You can also inspect objects:
  
      my $obj = SomeClass->new;
  
      p($obj);
  
  Which might give you something like:
  
    \ SomeClass  {
        Parents       Moose::Object
        Linear @ISA   SomeClass, Moose::Object
        public methods (3) : bar, foo, meta
        private methods (0)
        internals: {
           _something => 42,
        }
    }
  
  Data::Printer is fully customizable. If you want to change how things
  are displayed, or even its standard behavior. Take a look at the
  L<< available customizations|/"CUSTOMIZATION" >>. Once you figure out
  your own preferences, create a
  L<< configuration file|/"CONFIGURATION FILE (RUN CONTROL)" >> for
  yourself and Data::Printer will automatically use it!
  
  B<< That's about it! Feel free to stop reading now and start dumping
  your data structures! For more information, including feature set,
  how to create filters, and general tips, just keep reading :) >>
  
  Oh, if you are just experimenting and/or don't want to use a
  configuration file, you can set all options during initialization,
  including coloring, identation and filters!
  
    use Data::Printer {
        color => {
           'regex' => 'blue',
           'hash'  => 'yellow',
        },
        filters => {
           'DateTime' => sub { $_[0]->ymd },
           'SCALAR'   => sub { "oh noes, I found a scalar! $_[0]" },
        },
    };
  
  The first C<{}> block is just syntax sugar, you can safely ommit it
  if it makes things easier to read:
  
    use DDP colored => 1;
  
    use Data::Printer  deparse => 1, sort_keys => 0;
  
  
  =head1 FEATURES
  
  Here's what Data::Printer has to offer to Perl developers, out of the box:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * Very sane defaults (I hope!)
  
  =item * Highly customizable (in case you disagree with me :)
  
  =item * Colored output by default
  
  =item * Human-friendly output, with array index and custom separators
  
  =item * Full object dumps including methods, inheritance and internals
  
  =item * Exposes extra information such as tainted data and weak references
  
  =item * Ability to easily create filters for objects and regular structures
  
  =item * Ability to load settings from a C<.dataprinter> file so you don't have to write anything other than "use DDP;" in your code!
  
  =back
  
  =head1 RATIONALE
  
  Data::Dumper is a fantastic tool, meant to stringify data structures
  in a way they are suitable for being C<eval>'ed back in.
  
  The thing is, a lot of people keep using it (and similar ones,
  like Data::Dump) to print data structures and objects on screen
  for inspection and debugging, and while you B<can> use those
  modules for that, it doesn't mean mean you B<should>.
  
  This is where Data::Printer comes in. It is meant to do one thing
  and one thing only:
  
  I<< display Perl variables and objects on screen, properly
  formatted >> (to be inspected by a human)
  
  If you want to serialize/store/restore Perl data structures,
  this module will NOT help you. Try L<Storable>, L<Data::Dumper>,
  L<JSON>, or whatever. CPAN is full of such solutions!
  
  =head1 THE p() FUNCTION
  
  Once you load Data::Printer, the C<p()> function will be imported
  into your namespace and available to you. It will pretty-print
  into STDERR (or any other output target) whatever variabe you pass to it.
  
  =head2 Changing output targets
  
  By default, C<p()> will be set to use STDERR. As of version 0.27, you
  can set up the 'output' property so Data::Printer outputs to
  several different places:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * C<< output => 'stderr' >> - Standard error. Same as *STDERR
  
  =item * C<< output => 'stdout' >> - Standard output. Same as *STDOUT
  
  =item * C<< output => $filename >> - Appends to filename.
  
  =item * C<< output => $file_handle >> - Appends to opened handle
  
  =item * C<< output => \$scalar >> - Appends to that variable's content
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Return Value
  
  If for whatever reason you want to mangle with the output string
  instead of printing it, you can simply ask for a return
  value:
  
    # move to a string
    my $string = p @some_array;
  
    # output to STDOUT instead of STDERR;
    print p(%some_hash);
  
  Note that, in this case, Data::Printer will not colorize the
  returned string unless you explicitly set the C<colored> option to 1:
  
    print p(%some_hash, colored => 1); # now with colors!
  
  You can - and should - of course, set this during you "C<use>" call:
  
    use Data::Printer colored => 1;
    print p( %some_hash );  # will be colored
  
  Or by adding the setting to your C<.dataprinter> file.
  
  As most of Data::Printer, the return value is also configurable. You
  do this by setting the C<return_value> option. There are three options
  available:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * C<'dump'> (default):
  
      p %var;               # prints the dump to STDERR (void context)
      my $string = p %var;  # returns the dump *without* printing
  
  =item * C<'void'>:
  
      p %var;               # prints the dump to STDERR, never returns.
      my $string = p %var;  # $string is undef. Data still printed in STDERR
  
  
  =item * C<'pass'>:
  
      p %var;               # prints the dump to STDERR, returns %var
      my %copy = p %var;    # %copy = %var. Data still printed in STDERR
  
  =back
  
  =head1 COLORS AND COLORIZATION
  
  Below are all the available colorizations and their default values.
  Note that both spellings ('color' and 'colour') will work.
  
     use Data::Printer {
       color => {
          array       => 'bright_white',  # array index numbers
          number      => 'bright_blue',   # numbers
          string      => 'bright_yellow', # strings
          class       => 'bright_green',  # class names
          method      => 'bright_green',  # method names
          undef       => 'bright_red',    # the 'undef' value
          hash        => 'magenta',       # hash keys
          regex       => 'yellow',        # regular expressions
          code        => 'green',         # code references
          glob        => 'bright_cyan',   # globs (usually file handles)
          vstring     => 'bright_blue',   # version strings (v5.16.0, etc)
          repeated    => 'white on_red',  # references to seen values
          caller_info => 'bright_cyan',   # details on what's being printed
          weak        => 'cyan',          # weak references
          tainted     => 'red',           # tainted content
          escaped     => 'bright_red',    # escaped characters (\t, \n, etc)
  
          # potential new Perl datatypes, unknown to Data::Printer
          unknown     => 'bright_yellow on_blue',
       },
     };
  
  Don't fancy colors? Disable them with:
  
    use Data::Printer colored => 0;
  
  By default, 'colored' is set to C<"auto">, which means Data::Printer
  will colorize only when not being used to return the dump string,
  nor when the output (default: STDERR) is being piped. If you're not
  seeing colors, try forcing it with:
  
    use Data::Printer colored => 1;
  
  Also worth noticing that Data::Printer I<will> honor the
  C<ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED> environment variable unless you force a
  colored output by setting 'colored' to 1.
  
  Remember to put your preferred settings in the C<.dataprinter> file
  so you never have to type them at all!
  
  
  =head1 ALIASING
  
  Data::Printer provides the nice, short, C<p()> function to dump your
  data structures and objects. In case you rather use a more explicit
  name, already have a C<p()> function (why?) in your code and want
  to avoid clashing, or are just used to other function names for that
  purpose, you can easily rename it:
  
    use Data::Printer alias => 'Dumper';
  
    Dumper( %foo );
  
  
  =head1 CUSTOMIZATION
  
  I tried to provide sane defaults for Data::Printer, so you'll never have
  to worry about anything other than typing C<< "p( $var )" >> in your code.
  That said, and besides coloring and filtering, there are several other
  customization options available, as shown below (with default values):
  
    use Data::Printer {
        name           => 'var',   # name to display on cyclic references
        indent         => 4,       # how many spaces in each indent
        hash_separator => '   ',   # what separates keys from values
        colored        => 'auto',  # colorize output (1 for always, 0 for never)
        index          => 1,       # display array indices
        multiline      => 1,       # display in multiple lines (see note below)
        max_depth      => 0,       # how deep to traverse the data (0 for all)
        sort_keys      => 1,       # sort hash keys
        deparse        => 0,       # use B::Deparse to expand (expose) subroutines
        show_tied      => 1,       # expose tied variables
        show_tainted   => 1,       # expose tainted variables

    };
  
  Note: setting C<multiline> to C<0> will also set C<index> and C<indent> to C<0>.
  
  =head1 FILTERS
  
  Data::Printer offers you the ability to use filters to override
  any kind of data display. The filters are placed on a hash,
  where keys are the types - or class names - and values
  are anonymous subs that receive two arguments: the item itself
  as first parameter, and the properties hashref (in case your
  filter wants to read from it). This lets you quickly override
  the way Data::Printer handles and displays data types and, in
  particular, objects.
  
    use Data::Printer filters => {
              'DateTime'      => sub { $_[0]->ymd },
              'HTTP::Request' => sub { $_[0]->uri },
    };
  
  Perl types are named as C<ref> calls them: I<SCALAR>, I<ARRAY>,
  I<HASH>, I<REF>, I<CODE>, I<Regexp> and I<GLOB>. As for objects,
  just use the class' name, as shown above.
  
  As of version 0.13, you may also use the '-class' filter, which
  will be called for all non-perl types (objects).
  
  Your filters are supposed to return a defined value (usually, the
  string you want to print). If you don't, Data::Printer will
  let the next filter of that same type have a go, or just fallback
  to the defaults. You can also use an array reference to pass more
  than one filter for the same type or class.
  
  B<Note>: If you plan on calling C<p()> from I<within> an inline
  filter, please make sure you are passing only REFERENCES as
  arguments. See L</CAVEATS> below.
  
  You may also like to specify standalone filter modules. Please
  see L<Data::Printer::Filter> for further information on a more
  powerful filter interface for Data::Printer, including useful
  filters that are shipped as part of this distribution.
  
  =head1 MAKING YOUR CLASSES DDP-AWARE (WITHOUT ADDING ANY DEPS)
  
  Whenever printing the contents of a class, Data::Printer first
  checks to see if that class implements a sub called '_data_printer'
  (or whatever you set the "class_method" option to in your settings,
  see L</CUSTOMIZATION> below).
  
  If a sub with that exact name is available in the target object,
  Data::Printer will use it to get the string to print instead of
  making a regular class dump.
  
  This means you could have the following in one of your classes:
  
    sub _data_printer {
        my ($self, $properties) = @_;
        return 'Hey, no peeking! But foo contains ' . $self->foo;
    }
  
  Notice you don't have to depend on Data::Printer at all, just
  write your sub and it will use that to pretty-print your objects.
  
  If you want to use colors and filter helpers, and still not
  add Data::Printer to your dependencies, remember you can import
  them during runtime:
  
    sub _data_printer {
        require Data::Printer::Filter;
        Data::Printer::Filter->import;
  
        # now we have 'indent', outdent', 'linebreak', 'p' and 'colored'
        my ($self, $properties) = @_;
        ...
    }
  
  Having a filter for that particular class will of course override
  this setting.
  
  
  =head1 CONFIGURATION FILE (RUN CONTROL)
  
  Data::Printer tries to let you easily customize as much as possible
  regarding the visualization of your data structures and objects.
  But we don't want you to keep repeating yourself every time you
  want to use it!
  
  To avoid this, you can simply create a file called C<.dataprinter> in
  your home directory (usually C</home/username> in Linux), and put
  your configuration hash reference in there.
  
  This way, instead of doing something like:
  
     use Data::Printer {
       colour => {
          array => 'bright_blue',
       },
       filters => {
           'Catalyst::Request' => sub {
               my $req = shift;
               return "Cookies: " . p($req->cookies)
           },
       },
     };
  
  You can create a .dataprinter file that looks like this:
  
     {
       colour => {
          array => 'bright_blue',
       },
       filters => {
           'Catalyst::Request' => sub {
               my $req = shift;
               return "Cookies: " . p($req->cookies)
           },
       },
     };
  
  Note that all we did was remove the "use Data::Printer" bit when
  writing the C<.dataprinter> file. From then on all you have to do
  while debugging scripts is:
  
    use Data::Printer;
  
  and it will load your custom settings every time :)
  
  =head2 Loading RC files in custom locations
  
  If your RC file is somewhere other than C<.dataprinter> in your home
  dir, you can load whichever file you want via the C<'rc_file'> parameter:
  
    use Data::Printer rc_file => '/path/to/my/rcfile.conf';
  
  You can even set this to undef or to a non-existing file to disable your
  RC file at will.
  
  The RC file location can also be specified with the C<DATAPRINTERRC>
  environment variable. Using C<rc_file> in code will override the environment
  variable.
  
  =head2 RC File Security
  
  The C<.dataprinter> RC file is nothing but a Perl hash that
  gets C<eval>'d back into the code. This means that whatever
  is in your RC file B<WILL BE INTERPRETED BY PERL AT RUNTIME>.
  This can be quite worrying if you're not the one in control
  of the RC file.
  
  For this reason, Data::Printer takes extra precaution before
  loading the file:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * The file has to be in your home directory unless you
  specifically point elsewhere via the 'C<rc_file>' property or
  the DATAPRINTERRC environment variable;
  
  =item * The file B<must> be a plain file, never a symbolic
  link, named pipe or socket;
  
  =item * The file B<must> be owned by you (i.e. the effective
  user id that ran the script using Data::Printer);
  
  =item * The file B<must> be read-only for everyone but your user.
  This usually means permissions C<0644>, C<0640> or C<0600> in
  Unix-like systems. B<THIS IS NOT CHECKED IN WIN32>;
  
  =item * The file will B<NOT> be loaded in Taint mode, unless
  you specifically load Data::Printer with the 'allow_tainted'
  option set to true. And even if you do that, Data::Printer
  will still issue a warning before loading the file. But
  seriously, don't do that.
  
  =back
  
  Failure to comply with the security rules above will result in
  the RC file not being loaded (likely with a warning on what went
  wrong).
  
  
  =head1 THE "DDP" PACKAGE ALIAS
  
  You're likely to add/remove Data::Printer from source code being
  developed and debugged all the time, and typing it might feel too
  long. Because of this, the 'DDP' package is provided as a shorter
  alias to Data::Printer:
  
     use DDP;
     p %some_var;
  
  =head1 CALLER INFORMATION
  
  If you set caller_info to a true value, Data::Printer will prepend
  every call with an informational message. For example:
  
    use Data::Printer caller_info => 1;
  
    my $var = 42;
    p $var;
  
  will output something like:
  
    Printing in line 4 of myapp.pl:
    42
  
  The default message is C<< 'Printing in line __LINE__ of __FILENAME__:' >>.
  The special strings C<__LINE__>, C<__FILENAME__> and C<__PACKAGE__> will
  be interpolated into their according value so you can customize them at will:
  
    use Data::Printer
      caller_info => 1,
      caller_message => "Okay, __PACKAGE__, let's dance!"
      color => {
          caller_info => 'bright_red',
      };
  
  As shown above, you may also set a color for "caller_info" in your color
  hash. Default is cyan.
  
  
  =head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
  
  The following are volatile parts of the API which are subject to
  change at any given version. Use them at your own risk.
  
  =head2 Local Configuration (experimental!)
  
  You can override global configurations by writing them as the second
  parameter for p(). For example:
  
    p( %var, color => { hash => 'green' } );
  
  
  =head2 Filter classes
  
  As of Data::Printer 0.11, you can create complex filters as a separate
  module. Those can even be uploaded to CPAN and used by other people!
  See L<Data::Printer::Filter> for further information.
  
  =head1 CAVEATS
  
  You can't pass more than one variable at a time.
  
     p($foo, $bar); # wrong
     p($foo);       # right
     p($bar);       # right
  
  The default mode is to use prototypes, in which you are supposed to pass
  variables, not anonymous structures:
  
     p( { foo => 'bar' } ); # wrong
  
     p %somehash;        # right
     p $hash_ref;        # also right
  
  To pass anonymous structures, set "use_prototypes" option to 0. But
  remember you'll have to pass your variables as references:
  
     use Data::Printer use_prototypes => 0;
  
     p( { foo => 'bar' } ); # was wrong, now is right.
  
     p( %foo  ); # was right, but fails without prototypes
     p( \%foo ); # do this instead
  
  If you are using inline filters, and calling p() (or whatever name you
  aliased it to) from inside those filters, you B<must> pass the arguments
  to C<p()> as a reference:
  
    use Data::Printer {
        filters => {
            ARRAY => sub {
                my $listref = shift;
                my $string = '';
                foreach my $item (@$listref) {
                    $string .= p( \$item );      # p( $item ) will not work!
                }
                return $string;
            },
        },
    };
  
  This happens because your filter function is compiled I<before> Data::Printer
  itself loads, so the filter does not see the function prototype. As a way
  to avoid unpleasant surprises, if you forget to pass a reference, Data::Printer
  will generate an exception for you with the following message:
  
      'When calling p() without prototypes, please pass arguments as references'
  
  Another way to avoid this is to use the much more complete L<Data::Printer::Filter>
  interface for standalone filters.
  
  =head1 EXTRA TIPS
  
  =head2 Circumventing prototypes
  
  The C<p()> function uses prototypes by default, allowing you to say:
  
    p %var;
  
  instead of always having to pass references, like:
  
    p \%var;
  
  There are cases, however, where you may want to pass anonymous
  structures, like:
  
    p { foo => $bar };   # this blows up, don't use
  
  and because of prototypes, you can't. If this is your case, just
  set "use_prototypes" option to 0. Note, with this option,
  you B<will> have to pass your variables as references:
  
    use Data::Printer use_prototypes => 0;
  
     p { foo => 'bar' }; # doesn't blow up anymore, works just fine.
  
     p %var;  # but now this blows up...
     p \%var; # ...so do this instead
  
     p [ $foo, $bar, \@baz ]; # this way you can even pass
                              # several variables at once
  
  Versions prior to 0.17 don't have the "use_prototypes" option. If
  you're stuck in an older version you can write C<&p()> instead of C<p()>
  to circumvent prototypes and pass elements (including anonymous variables)
  as B<REFERENCES>. This notation, however, requires enclosing parentheses:
  
    &p( { foo => $bar } );        # this is ok, use at will
    &p( \"DEBUGGING THIS BIT" );  # this works too
  
  Or you could just create a very simple wrapper function:
  
    sub pp { p @_ };
  
  And use it just as you use C<p()>.
  
  =head2 Minding the return value of p()
  
  I<< (contributed by Matt S. Trout (mst)) >>
  
  There is a reason why explicit return statements are recommended unless
  you know what you're doing. By default, Data::Printer's return value
  depends on how it was called. When not in void context, it returns the
  serialized form of the dump.
  
  It's tempting to trust your own p() calls with that approach, but if
  this is your I<last> statement in a function, you should keep in mind
  your debugging code will behave differently depending on how your
  function was called!
  
  To prevent that, set the C<return_value> property to either 'void'
  or 'pass'. You won't be able to retrieve the dumped string but, hey,
  who does that anyway :)
  
  Assuming you have set the pass-through ('pass') property in your
  C<.dataprinter> file, another stunningly useful thing you can do with it
  is change code that says:
  
     return $obj->foo;
  
  with:
  
     use DDP;
  
     return p $obj->foo;
  
  You can even add it to chained calls if you wish to see the dump of
  a particular state, changing this:
  
     $obj->foo->bar->baz;
  
  to:
  
     $obj->foo->DDP::p->bar->baz
  
  And things will "Just Work".
  
  
  =head2 Using p() in some/all of your loaded modules
  
  I<< (contributed by Matt S. Trout (mst)) >>
  
  While debugging your software, you may want to use Data::Printer in
  some or all loaded modules and not bother having to load it in
  each and every one of them. To do this, in any module loaded by
  C<myapp.pl>, simply write:
  
    ::p( @myvar );  # note the '::' in front of p()
  
  Then call your program like:
  
    perl -MDDP myapp.pl
  
  This also has the great advantage that if you leave one p() call
  in by accident, it will fail without the -M, making it easier to spot :)
  
  If you really want to have p() imported into your loaded
  modules, use the next tip instead.
  
  =head2 Adding p() to all your loaded modules
  
  I<< (contributed by Árpád Szász) >>
  
  If you wish to automatically add Data::Printer's C<p()> function to
  every loaded module in you app, you can do something like this to
  your main program:
  
      BEGIN {
          {
              no strict 'refs';
              require Data::Printer;
              my $alias = 'p';
              foreach my $package ( keys %main:: ) {
                  if ( $package =~ m/::$/ ) {
                      *{ $package . $alias } = \&Data::Printer::p;
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  
  B<WARNING> This will override all locally defined subroutines/methods that
  are named C<p>, if they exist, in every loaded module. If you already
  have a subroutine named 'C<p()>', be sure to change C<$alias> to
  something custom.
  
  If you rather avoid namespace manipulation altogether, use the previous
  tip instead.
  
  =head2 Using Data::Printer from the Perl debugger
  
  I<< (contributed by Árpád Szász and Marcel Grünauer (hanekomu)) >>
  
  With L<DB::Pluggable>, you can easily set the perl debugger to use
  Data::Printer to print variable information, replacing the debugger's
  standard C<p()> function. All you have to do is add these lines to
  your C<.perldb> file:
  
    use DB::Pluggable;
    DB::Pluggable->run_with_config( \'[DataPrinter]' );  # note the '\'
  
  Then call the perl debugger as you normally would:
  
    perl -d myapp.pl
  
  Now Data::Printer's C<p()> command will be used instead of the debugger's!
  
  See L<perldebug> for more information on how to use the perl debugger, and
  L<DB::Pluggable> for extra functionality and other plugins.
  
  If you can't or don't wish to use DB::Pluggable, or simply want to keep
  the debugger's C<p()> function and add an extended version using
  Data::Printer (let's call it C<px()> for instance), you can add these
  lines to your C<.perldb> file instead:
  
      $DB::alias{px} = 's/px/DB::px/';
      sub px {
          my $expr = shift;
          require Data::Printer;
          print Data::Printer::p($expr);
      }
  
  Now, inside the Perl debugger, you can pass as reference to C<px> expressions
  to be dumped using Data::Printer.
  
  =head2 Using Data::Printer in a perl shell (REPL)
  
  Some people really enjoy using a REPL shell to quickly try Perl code. One
  of the most famous ones out there is L<Devel::REPL>. If you use it, now
  you can also see its output with Data::Printer!
  
  Just install L<Devel::REPL::Plugin::DataPrinter> and add the following
  line to your re.pl configuration file (usually ".re.pl/repl.rc" in your
  home dir):
  
    load_plugin('DataPrinter');
  
  The next time you run C<re.pl>, it should dump all your REPL using
  Data::Printer!
  
  =head2 Easily rendering Data::Printer's output as HTML
  
  To turn Data::Printer's output into HTML, you can do something like:
  
    use HTML::FromANSI;
    use Data::Printer;
    
    my $html_output = ansi2html( p($object, colored => 1) );
  
  In the example above, the C<$html_output> variable contains the
  HTML escaped output of C<p($object)>, so you can print it for
  later inspection or render it (if it's a web app).
  
  =head2 Using Data::Printer with Template Toolkit
  
  I<< (contributed by Stephen Thirlwall (sdt)) >>
  
  If you use Template Toolkit and want to dump your variables using Data::Printer,
  install the L<Template::Plugin::DataPrinter> module and load it in your template:
  
     [% USE DataPrinter %]
  
  The provided methods match those of C<Template::Plugin::Dumper>:
  
     ansi-colored dump of the data structure in "myvar":
     [% DataPrinter.dump( myvar ) %]
  
     html-formatted, colored dump of the same data structure:
     [% DataPrinter.dump_html( myvar ) %]
  
  The module allows several customization options, even letting you load it as a
  complete drop-in replacement for Template::Plugin::Dumper so you don't even have
  to change your previous templates!
  
  =head2 Unified interface for Data::Printer and other debug formatters
  
  I<< (contributed by Kevin McGrath (catlgrep)) >>
  
  If you are porting your code to use Data::Printer instead of
  Data::Dumper or similar, you can just replace:
  
    use Data::Dumper;
  
  with:
  
    use Data::Printer alias => 'Dumper';
    # use Data::Dumper;
  
  making sure to provide Data::Printer with the proper alias for the
  previous dumping function.
  
  If, however, you want a really unified approach where you can easily
  flip between debugging outputs, use L<Any::Renderer> and its plugins,
  like L<Any::Renderer::Data::Printer>.
  
  =head2 Printing stack traces with arguments expanded using Data::Printer
  
  I<< (contributed by Sergey Aleynikov (randir)) >>
  
  There are times where viewing the current state of a variable is not
  enough, and you want/need to see a full stack trace of a function call.
  
  The L<Devel::PrettyTrace> module uses Data::Printer to provide you just
  that. It exports a C<bt()> function that pretty-prints detailed information
  on each function in your stack, making it easier to spot any issues!
  
  =head2 Troubleshooting apps in real time without changing a single line of your code
  
  I<< (contributed by Marcel Grünauer (hanekomu)) >>
  
  L<dip> is a dynamic instrumentation framework for troubleshooting Perl
  programs, similar to L<DTrace|http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/>.
  In a nutshell, C<dip> lets you create probes for certain conditions
  in your application that, once met, will perform a specific action. Since
  it uses Aspect-oriented programming, it's very lightweight and you only
  pay for what you use.
  
  C<dip> can be very useful since it allows you to debug your software
  without changing a single line of your original code. And Data::Printer
  comes bundled with it, so you can use the C<p()> function to view your
  data structures too!
  
     # Print a stack trace every time the name is changed,
     # except when reading from the database.
     dip -e 'before { print longmess(p $_->{args}[1]) if $_->{args}[1] }
       call "MyObj::name" & !cflow("MyObj::read")' myapp.pl
  
  You can check you L<dip>'s own documentation for more information and options.
  
  =head2 Sample output for color fine-tuning
  
  I<< (contributed by Yanick Champoux (yanick)) >>
  
  The "examples/try_me.pl" file included in this distribution has a sample
  dump with a complex data structure to let you quickly test color schemes.
  
  =head2 creating fiddling filters
  
  I<< (contributed by dirk) >>
  
  Sometimes, you may want to take advantage of Data::Printer's original dump,
  but add/change some of the original data to enhance your debugging ability.
  Say, for example, you have an C<HTTP::Response> object you want to print
  but the content is encoded. The basic approach, of course, would be to
  just dump the decoded content:
  
    use DDP filter {
      'HTTP::Response' => sub { p( \shift->decoded_content, %{shift} );
    };
  
  But what if you want to see the rest of the original object? Dumping it
  would be a no-go, because you would just recurse forever in your own filter.
  
  Never fear! When you create a filter in Data::Printer, you're not replacing
  the original one, you're just stacking yours on top of it. To forward your data
  to the original filter, all you have to do is return an undefined value. This
  means you can rewrite your C<HTTP::Response> filter like so, if you want:
  
    use DDP filters => {
      'HTTP::Response' => sub {
        my ($res, $p) = @_;
  
        # been here before? Switch to original handler
        return if exists $res->{decoded_content};
  
        # first timer? Come on in!
        my $clone = $res->clone;
        $clone->{decoded_content} = $clone->decoded_content;
        return p($clone, %$p);
      }
    };
  
  And voilà! Your fiddling filter now works like a charm :)

  Data::Printer::Filter - Create powerful stand-alone filters for Data::Printer
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  Create your filter module:
  
    package Data::Printer::Filter::MyFilter;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
  
    use Data::Printer::Filter;
  
    # type filter
    filter 'SCALAR', sub {
        my ($ref, $properties) = @_;
        my $val = $$ref;
        
        if ($val > 100) {
            return 'too big!!';
        }
        else {
            return $val;
        }
    };
  
    # you can also filter objects of any class
    filter 'Some::Class', sub {
        my ($object, $properties) = @_;
  
        return $ref->some_method;   # or whatever
  
        # see 'HELPER FUNCTIONS' below for
        # customization options, including
        # proper indentation.
    };
  
    1;
  
  
  Later, in your main code:
  
    use Data::Printer {
        filters => {
            -external => [ 'MyFilter', 'OtherFilter' ],
  
            # you can still add regular (inline) filters
            SCALAR => sub {
                ...
            }
        },
    };
  
  
  
  =head1 WARNING - ALPHA CODE (VERY LOOSE API)
  
  We are still experimenting with the standalone filter syntax, so
  B<< filters written like so may break in the future without any warning! >>
  
  B<< If you care, or have any suggestions >>, please drop me a line via RT, email,
  or find me ('garu') on irc.perl.org.
  
  You have been warned.
  
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  L<Data::Printer> lets you add custom filters to display data structures and
  objects, by either specifying them during "use", in the C<.dataprinter>
  configuration file, or even in runtime customizations.
  
  But there are times when you may want to group similar filters, or make
  them standalone in order to be easily reutilized in other environments and
  applications, or even upload them to CPAN so other people can benefit from
  a cleaner - and clearer - object/structure dump.
  
  This is where C<Data::Printer::Filter> comes in. It B<exports> into your
  package's namespace the L</filter> function, along with some helpers to
  create custom filter packages.
  
  L<Data::Printer> recognizes all filters in the C<Data::Printer::Filter::*>
  namespace. You can load them by specifying them in the '-external' filter
  list (note the dash, to avoid clashing with a potential class or pragma
  labelled 'external'):
  
    use Data::Printer {
        filters => {
            -external => 'MyFilter',
        },
    };
  
  This will load all filters defined by the C<Data::Printer::Filter::MyFilter>
  module.
  
  If there are more than one filter, use an array reference instead:
  
    -external => [ 'MyFilter', 'MyOtherFilter' ]
  
  B<< IMPORTANT: THIS WAY OF LOADING EXTERNAL PLUGINS IS EXPERIMENTAL AND
  SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGE! IF YOU CARE, AND/OR HAVE IDEAS ON A BETTER API,
  PLEASE LET US KNOW >>
  
  =head1 HELPER FUNCTIONS
  
  =head2 filter TYPE, sub { ... };
  
  The C<filter> function creates a new filter for I<TYPE>, using
  the given subref. The subref receives two arguments: the item
  itself - be it an object or a reference to a standard Perl type -
  and the properties in effect (so you can inspect for certain
  options, etc). The subroutine is expected to return a string
  containing whatever it wants C<Data::Printer> to display on screen.
  
  =head2 p()
  
  This is the same as C<Data::Printer>'s p(), only you can't rename it.
  You can use this to throw some data structures back at C<Data::Printer>
  and use the results in your own return string - like when manipulating
  hashes or arrays.
  
  =head2 newline()
  
  This helper returns a string using the linebreak as specified by the
  caller's settings. For instance, it provides the proper indentation
  level of spaces for you and considers the C<multiline> option to
  avoid line breakage.
  
  In other words, if you do this:
  
     filter ARRAY => {
         my ($ref, $p) = @_;
         my $string = "Hey!! I got this array:";
  
         foreach my $val (@$ref) {
             $string .= newline . p($val);
         }
  
         return $string;
     };
  
  ... your C<p($val)> returns will be properly indented, vertically aligned
  to your level of the data structure, while simply using "\n" would just
  make things messy if your structure has more than one level of depth.
  
  =head2 indent()
  
  =head2 outdent()
  
  These two helpers let you increase/decrease the indentation level of
  your data display, for C<newline()> and nested C<p()> calls inside your filters.
  
  For example, the filter defined in the C<newline> explanation above would
  show the values on the same (vertically aligned) level as the "I got this array"
  message. If you wanted your array to be one level further deep, you could use
  this instead:
  
    filter ARRAY => {
        my ($ref, $p) = @_;
        my $string = "Hey!! I got this array:";
  
        indent;
        foreach my $val (@$ref) {
            $string .= newline . p($val);
        }
        outdent;
  
        return $string;
    };
  
  
  =head1 COLORIZATION
  
  You can use L<Term::ANSIColor>'s C<colored()>' for string
  colorization. Data::Printer will automatically enable/disable
  colors for you.
  
  =head1 EXISTING FILTERS
  
  This is meant to provide a complete list of standalone filters for
  Data::Printer available on CPAN. If you write one, please put it under
  the C<Data::Printer::Filter::*> namespace, and drop me a line so I can
  add it to this list!
  
  =head2 Databases
  
  L<Data::Printer::Filter::DB> provides filters for Database objects. So
  far only DBI is covered, but more to come!
  
  =head2 Dates & Times
  
  L<Data::Printer::Filter::DateTime> pretty-prints several date
  and time objects (not just DateTime) for you on the fly, including
  duration/delta objects!
  
  =head2 Digest
  
  L<Data::Printer::Filter::Digest> displays a string containing the
  hash of the actual message digest instead of the object. Works on
  C<Digest::MD5>, C<Digest::SHA>, any digest class that inherits from
  C<Digest::base> and some others that implement their own thing!
  
  =head2 ClassicRegex
  
  L<Data::Printer::Filter::ClassicRegex> changes the way Data::Printer
  dumps regular expressions, doing it the classic C<qr//> way that got
  popular in C<Data::Dumper>.
  
  =head2 URI
  
  L<Data::Printer::Filter::URI> pretty-prints L<URI> objects, displaying
  the URI as a string instead of dumping the object.
  
  =head2 JSON
  
  L<Data::Printer::Filter::JSON> lets you see your JSON structures
  replacing boolean objects with simple C<true/false> strings!
  
  =head2 URIs
  
  L<Data::Printer::Filter::URI> filters through several L<URI> manipulation
  classes and displays the URI as a colored string. A very nice addition
  by Stanislaw Pusep (SYP).
  
  =head1 USING MORE THAN ONE FILTER FOR THE SAME TYPE/CLASS
  
  As of version 0.13, standalone filters let you stack together
  filters for the same type or class. Filters of the same type are
  called in order, until one of them returns a string. This lets
  you have several filters inspecting the same given value until
  one of them decides to actually treat it somehow.
  
  If your filter catched a value and you don't want to treat it,
  simply return and the next filter will be called. If there are no
  other filters for that particular class or type available, the
  standard Data::Printer calls will be used.
  
  For example:
  
    filter SCALAR => sub {
        my ($ref, $properties) = @_;
        if ( Scalar::Util::looks_like_number $$ref ) {
            return sprintf "%.8d", $$ref;
        }
        return; # lets the other SCALAR filter have a go
    };
  
    filter SCALAR => sub {
        my ($ref, $properties) = @_;
        return qq["$$ref"];
    };
  
  Note that this "filter stack" is not possible on inline filters, since
  it's a hash and keys with the same name are overwritten. Instead, you
  can pass them as an array reference:
  
    use Data::Printer filters => {
        SCALAR => [ sub { ... }, sub { ... } ],
    };

  =head1 NAME
  
  Data::Printer::Filter::DB - pretty printing database objects
  
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  In your program:
  
    use Data::Printer filters => {
        -external => [ 'DB' ],
    };
  
  or, in your C<.dataprinter> file:
  
    {
      filters => {
        -external => [ 'DB' ],
      },
    };
  
  
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This is a filter plugin for L<Data::Printer>. It filters through
  L<DBI>'s handlers (dbh) and statement (sth) objects displaying relevant
  information for the user.
  
  L<DBI> is an extremely powerful and complete database interface. But
  it does a lot of magic under the hood, making their objects somewhat harder
  to debug. This filter aims to fix that :)
  
  For instance, say you want to debug something like this:
  
    use DBI;
    my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:DBM(RaiseError=1):', undef, undef );
  
  A regular Data::Dumper output gives you absolutely nothing:

  L<Data::Printer> makes it better, but only to debug the class itself,
  not helpful at all to see its contents and debug your own code:
  
      DBI::db  {
          Parents       DBI::common
          Linear @ISA   DBI::db, DBI::common
          public methods (48) : begin_work, clone, column_info, commit, connected, data_sources, disconnect, do, foreign_key_info, get_info, last_insert_id, ping, prepare, prepare_cached, preparse, primary_key, primary_key_info, quote, quote_identifier, rollback, rows, selectall_arrayref, selectall_hashref, selectcol_arrayref, selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, selectrow_hashref, sqlite_backup_from_file, sqlite_backup_to_file, sqlite_busy_timeout, sqlite_collation_needed, sqlite_commit_hook, sqlite_create_aggregate, sqlite_create_collation, sqlite_create_function, sqlite_enable_load_extension, sqlite_last_insert_rowid, sqlite_progress_handler, sqlite_register_fts3_perl_tokenizer, sqlite_rollback_hook, sqlite_set_authorizer, sqlite_update_hook, statistics_info, table_info, tables, take_imp_data, type_info, type_info_all
          private methods (0)
          internals: {
          }
      }
  
  Fear no more! If you use this filter, here's what you'll see:
  
      SQLite Database Handle (connected) {
          dbname: file.db
          Auto Commit: 1
          Statement Handles: 0
          Last Statement: -
      }
  
  Much better, huh? :)
  
  Statement handlers are even better. Imagine you continued your code with something like:
  
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar = ?');
    $sth->execute(42);
  
  With this filter, instead of an empty dump or full method information, you'll get
  exactly what you came for:
  
   SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar = ?  (42)
  
  Note that if your driver does not support holding of parameter values, you'll get a
  C<bindings unavailable> message instead of the bound values.

    use Data::Printer
        filters => {
            -external => [ 'DateTime' ],
        },
        color   => {

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This is a filter plugin for L<Data::Printer>. It filters through
  several digest classes and displays their current value in
  hexadecimal format as a string.
  
  =head2 Parsed Modules

  =head2 Extra Options
  
  Aside from the display color, there are a few other options to
  be customized via the C<digest> option key:
  
  =head3 show_class_name
  
  Set this to true to display the class name right next to the
  hexadecimal digest. Default is 0 (false).
  
  =head3 show_reset
  
  If set to true (the default), the filter will add a C<[reset]>
  tag after dumping an empty digest object. See the rationale below.
  
  =head2 Note on dumping Digest::* objects
  
  The digest operation is effectively a destructive, read-once operation. Once it has been performed, most Digest::* objects are automatically reset and can be used to calculate another digest value.
  
  This behaviour - or, rather, forgetting about this behaviour - is
  a common source of issues when working with Digests.
  
  This Data::Printer filter will B<not> destroy your object. Instead, we work on a cloned version to display the hexdigest, leaving your
  original object untouched.
  
  As another debugging convenience for developers, since the empty
  object will produce a digest even after being used, this filter
  adds by default a C<[reset]> tag to indicate that the object is
  empty, in a 'reset' state - i.e. its hexdigest is the same as
  the hexdigest of a new, empty object of that same class.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Fatal - Replace functions with equivalents which succeed or die
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Fatal qw(open close);
  
      open(my $fh, "<", $filename);  # No need to check errors!
  
      use File::Copy qw(move);
      use Fatal qw(move);
  
      move($file1, $file2); # No need to check errors!
  
      sub juggle { . . . }
      Fatal->import('juggle');
  
  =head1 BEST PRACTICE
  
  B<Fatal has been obsoleted by the new L<autodie> pragma.> Please use
  L<autodie> in preference to C<Fatal>.  L<autodie> supports lexical scoping,
  throws real exception objects, and provides much nicer error messages.
  
  The use of C<:void> with Fatal is discouraged.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Fatal> provides a way to conveniently replace
  functions which normally return a false value when they fail with
  equivalents which raise exceptions if they are not successful.  This
  lets you use these functions without having to test their return
  values explicitly on each call.  Exceptions can be caught using
  C<eval{}>.  See L<perlfunc> and L<perlvar> for details.
  
  The do-or-die equivalents are set up simply by calling Fatal's
  C<import> routine, passing it the names of the functions to be
  replaced.  You may wrap both user-defined functions and overridable
  CORE operators (except C<exec>, C<system>, C<print>, or any other
  built-in that cannot be expressed via prototypes) in this way.
  
  If the symbol C<:void> appears in the import list, then functions
  named later in that import list raise an exception only when
  these are called in void context--that is, when their return
  values are ignored.  For example
  
      use Fatal qw/:void open close/;
  
      # properly checked, so no exception raised on error
      if (not open(my $fh, '<', '/bogotic') {
          warn "Can't open /bogotic: $!";
      }
  
      # not checked, so error raises an exception
      close FH;
  
  The use of C<:void> is discouraged, as it can result in exceptions
  not being thrown if you I<accidentally> call a method without
  void context.  Use L<autodie> instead if you need to be able to
  disable autodying/Fatal behaviour for a small block of code.
  
  =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item Bad subroutine name for Fatal: %s
  
  You've called C<Fatal> with an argument that doesn't look like
  a subroutine name, nor a switch that this version of Fatal
  understands.
  
  =item %s is not a Perl subroutine
  
  You've asked C<Fatal> to try and replace a subroutine which does not
  exist, or has not yet been defined.
  
  =item %s is neither a builtin, nor a Perl subroutine
  
  You've asked C<Fatal> to replace a subroutine, but it's not a Perl
  built-in, and C<Fatal> couldn't find it as a regular subroutine.
  It either doesn't exist or has not yet been defined.
  
  =item Cannot make the non-overridable %s fatal
  
  You've tried to use C<Fatal> on a Perl built-in that can't be
  overridden, such as C<print> or C<system>, which means that
  C<Fatal> can't help you, although some other modules might.
  See the L</"SEE ALSO"> section of this documentation.
  
  =item Internal error: %s
  
  You've found a bug in C<Fatal>.  Please report it using
  the C<perlbug> command.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 BUGS
  
  C<Fatal> clobbers the context in which a function is called and always
  makes it a scalar context, except when the C<:void> tag is used.
  This problem does not exist in L<autodie>.
  
  "Used only once" warnings can be generated when C<autodie> or C<Fatal>
  is used with package filehandles (eg, C<FILE>).  It's strongly recommended
  you use scalar filehandles instead.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  B<File::HomeDir> is a module for locating the directories that are "owned"
  by a user (typicaly your user) and to solve the various issues that arise
  trying to find them consistently across a wide variety of platforms.
  
  The end result is a single API that can find your resources on any platform,
  making it relatively trivial to create Perl software that works elegantly
  and correctly no matter where you run it.
  
  This module provides two main interfaces.
  
  The first is a modern L<File::Spec>-style interface with a consistent
  OO API and different implementation modules to support various
  platforms. You are B<strongly> recommended to use this interface.
  
  The second interface is for legacy support of the original 0.07 interface
  that exported a C<home()> function by default and tied the C<%~> variable.
  
  It is generally not recommended that you use this interface, but due to
  back-compatibility reasons they will remain supported until at least 2010.
  
  The C<%~> interface has been deprecated. Documentation was removed in 2009,
  Unit test were removed in 2011, usage will issue warnings from 2012, and the
  interface will be removed entirely in 2015  (in line with the general Perl
  toolchain convention of a 10 year support period for legacy APIs that
  are potentially or actually in common use).
  
  =head2 Platform Neutrality
  
  In the Unix world, many different types of data can be mixed together
  in your home directory (although on some Unix platforms this is no longer
  the case, particularly for "desktop"-oriented platforms).
  
  On some non-Unix platforms, separate directories are allocated for
  different types of data and have been for a long time.
  
  When writing applications on top of B<File::HomeDir>, you should thus
  always try to use the most specific method you can. User documents should
  be saved in C<my_documents>, data that supports an application but isn't
  normally editing by the user directory should go into C<my_data>.
  
  On platforms that do not make any distinction, all these different
  methods will harmlessly degrade to the main home directory, but on
  platforms that care B<File::HomeDir> will always try to Do The Right
  Thing(tm).
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  Two types of methods are provided. The C<my_method> series of methods for
  finding resources for the current user, and the C<users_method> (read as
  "user's method") series for finding resources for arbitrary users.
  
  This split is necessary, as on most platforms it is B<much> easier to find
  information about the current user compared to other users, and indeed
  on a number you cannot find out information such as C<users_desktop> at
  all, due to security restrictions.
  
  All methods will double check (using a C<-d> test) that a directory
  actually exists before returning it, so you may trust in the values
  that are returned (subject to the usual caveats of race conditions of
  directories being deleted at the moment between a directory being returned
  and you using it).
  
  However, because in some cases platforms may not support the concept of home
  directories at all, any method may return C<undef> (both in scalar and list
  context) to indicate that there is no matching directory on the system.
  
  For example, most untrusted 'nobody'-type users do not have a home
  directory. So any modules that are used in a CGI application that
  at some level of recursion use your code, will result in calls to
  File::HomeDir returning undef, even for a basic home() call.
  
  =head2 my_home
  
  The C<my_home> method takes no arguments and returns the main home/profile
  directory for the current user.
  
  If the distinction is important to you, the term "current" refers to the
  real user, and not the effective user.
  
  This is also the case for all of the other "my" methods.
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if the current user
  does not have a home directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 my_desktop
  
  The C<my_desktop> method takes no arguments and returns the "desktop"
  directory for the current user.
  
  Due to the diversity and complexity of implementions required to deal with
  implementing the required functionality fully and completely, the
  C<my_desktop> method may or may not be implemented on each platform.
  
  That said, I am extremely interested in code to implement C<my_desktop> on
  Unix, as long as it is capable of dealing (as the Windows implementation
  does) with internationalisation. It should also avoid false positive
  results by making sure it only returns the appropriate directories for the
  appropriate platforms.
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if the current user
  does not have a desktop directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 my_documents
  
  The C<my_documents> method takes no arguments and returns the directory (for
  the current user) where the user's documents are stored.
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if the current user
  does not have a documents directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 my_music
  
  The C<my_music> method takes no arguments and returns the directory
  where the current user's music is stored.
  
  No bias is made to any particular music type or music program, rather the
  concept of a directory to hold the user's music is made at the level of the
  underlying operating system or (at least) desktop environment.
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if the current user
  does not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 my_pictures
  
  The C<my_pictures> method takes no arguments and returns the directory
  where the current user's pictures are stored.
  
  No bias is made to any particular picture type or picture program, rather the
  concept of a directory to hold the user's pictures is made at the level of the
  underlying operating system or (at least) desktop environment.
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if the current user
  does not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 my_videos
  
  The C<my_videos> method takes no arguments and returns the directory
  where the current user's videos are stored.
  
  No bias is made to any particular video type or video program, rather the
  concept of a directory to hold the user's videos is made at the level of the
  underlying operating system or (at least) desktop environment.
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if the current user
  does not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 my_data
  
  The C<my_data> method takes no arguments and returns the directory where
  local applications should stored their internal data for the current
  user.
  
  Generally an application would create a subdirectory such as C<.foo>,
  beneath this directory, and store its data there. By creating your
  directory this way, you get an accurate result on the maximum number of
  platforms. But see the documentation about C<my_dist_config()> or
  C<my_dist_data()> below.
  
  For example, on Unix you get C<~/.foo> and on Win32 you get
  C<~/Local Settings/Application Data/.foo>
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if the current user
  does not have a data directory, or dies on error.
  
  
  =head2 my_dist_config
  
    File::HomeDir->my_dist_config( $dist [, \%params] );
    
    # For example...
    
    File::HomeDir->my_dist_config( 'File-HomeDir' );
    File::HomeDir->my_dist_config( 'File-HomeDir', { create => 1 } );
  
  The C<my_dist_config> method takes a distribution name as argument and
  returns an application-specific directory where they should store their
  internal configuration.
  
  The base directory will be either C<my_config> if the platform supports
  it, or C<my_documents> otherwise. The subdirectory itself will be 
  C<BASE/Perl/Dist-Name>. If the base directory is the user's homedir,
  C<my_dist_config> will be in C<~/.perl/Dist-Name> (and thus be hidden on
  all Unixes).
  
  The optional last argument is a hash reference to tweak the method
  behaviour. The following hash keys are recognized:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * create
  
  Passing a true value to this key will force the creation of the
  directory if it doesn't exist (remember that C<File::HomeDir>'s policy
  is to return C<undef> if the directory doesn't exist).
  
  Defaults to false, meaning no automatic creation of directory.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 my_dist_data
  
    File::HomeDir->my_dist_data( $dist [, \%params] );
    
    # For example...
    
    File::HomeDir->my_dist_data( 'File-HomeDir' );
    File::HomeDir->my_dist_data( 'File-HomeDir', { create => 1 } );
  
  The C<my_dist_data> method takes a distribution name as argument and
  returns an application-specific directory where they should store their
  internal data.
  
  This directory will be of course a subdirectory of C<my_data>. Platforms
  supporting data-specific directories will use
  C<DATA_DIR/perl/dist/Dist-Name> following the common
  "DATA/vendor/application" pattern. If the C<my_data> directory is the
  user's homedir, C<my_dist_data> will be in C<~/.perl/dist/Dist-Name>
  (and thus be hidden on all Unixes).
  
  The optional last argument is a hash reference to tweak the method
  behaviour. The following hash keys are recognized:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * create
  
  Passing a true value to this key will force the creation of the
  directory if it doesn't exist (remember that C<File::HomeDir>'s policy
  is to return C<undef> if the directory doesn't exist).
  
  Defaults to false, meaning no automatic creation of directory.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 users_home
  
    $home = File::HomeDir->users_home('foo');
  
  The C<users_home> method takes a single param and is used to locate the
  parent home/profile directory for an identified user on the system.
  
  While most of the time this identifier would be some form of user name,
  it is permitted to vary per-platform to support user ids or UUIDs as
  applicable for that platform.
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if that user
  does not have a home directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 users_documents
  
    $docs = File::HomeDir->users_documents('foo');
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if that user
  does not have a documents directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head2 users_data
  
    $data = File::HomeDir->users_data('foo');
  
  Returns the directory path as a string, C<undef> if that user
  does not have a data directory, or dies on error.
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONS
  
  =head2 home
  
    use File::HomeDir;
    $home = home();
    $home = home('foo');
    $home = File::HomeDir::home();
    $home = File::HomeDir::home('foo');
  
  The C<home> function is exported by default and is provided for
  compatibility with legacy applications. In new applications, you should
  use the newer method-based interface above.
  
  Returns the directory path to a named user's home/profile directory.
  
  If provided no param, returns the directory path to the current user's
  home/profile directory.
  
  =head1 TO DO
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * Add more granularity to Unix, and add support to VMS and other
  esoteric platforms, so we can consider going core.
  
  =item * Add consistent support for users_* methods

  File::HomeDir::Darwin - Find your home and other directories on Darwin (OS X)
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides Darwin-specific implementations for determining
  common user directories.  In normal usage this module will always be
  used via L<File::HomeDir>.
  
  Note -- since this module requires Mac::Carbon and Mac::Carbon does
  not work with 64-bit perls, on such systems, File::HomeDir will try
  L<File::HomeDir::Darwin::Cocoa> and then fall back to the (pure Perl)
  L<File::HomeDir::Darwin>.
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use File::HomeDir;
  
    # Find directories for the current user
    $home    = File::HomeDir->my_home;      # /Users/mylogin
    $desktop = File::HomeDir->my_desktop;   # /Users/mylogin/Desktop
    $docs    = File::HomeDir->my_documents; # /Users/mylogin/Documents
    $music   = File::HomeDir->my_music;     # /Users/mylogin/Music
    $pics    = File::HomeDir->my_pictures;  # /Users/mylogin/Pictures
    $videos  = File::HomeDir->my_videos;    # /Users/mylogin/Movies

  File::HomeDir::Darwin::Cocoa - Find your home and other directories on Darwin (OS X)
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides Darwin-specific implementations for determining
  common user directories using Cocoa API through
  L<Mac::SystemDirectory>.  In normal usage this module will always be
  used via L<File::HomeDir>.
  
  Theoretically, this should return the same paths as both of the other
  Darwin drivers.
  
  Because this module requires L<Mac::SystemDirectory>, if the module
  is not installed, L<File::HomeDir> will fall back to L<File::HomeDir::Darwin>.

  File::HomeDir::Test - Prevent the accidental creation of user-owned files during testing
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use Test::More test => 1;
    use File::HomeDir::Test;
    use File::HomeDir;
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  B<File::HomeDir::Test> is a L<File::HomeDir> driver intended for use in the test scripts
  of modules or applications that write files into user-owned directories.
  
  It is designed to prevent the pollution of user directories with files that are not part
  of the application install itself, but were created during testing. These files can leak
  state information from the tests into the run-time usage of an application, and on Unix
  systems also prevents tests (which may be executed as root via sudo) from writing files
  which cannot later be modified or removed by the regular user.
  
  =head1 SUPPORT

  File::HomeDir::Windows - Find your home and other directories on Windows
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use File::HomeDir;
    
    # Find directories for the current user (eg. using Windows XP Professional)
    $home    = File::HomeDir->my_home;        # C:\Documents and Settings\mylogin
    $desktop = File::HomeDir->my_desktop;     # C:\Documents and Settings\mylogin\Desktop
    $docs    = File::HomeDir->my_documents;   # C:\Documents and Settings\mylogin\My Documents

    $videos  = File::HomeDir->my_videos;      # C:\Documents and Settings\mylogin\My Documents\My Video
    $data    = File::HomeDir->my_data;        # C:\Documents and Settings\mylogin\Local Settings\Application Data
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides Windows-specific implementations for determining
  common user directories.  In normal usage this module will always be
  used via L<File::HomeDir>.
  
  Internally this module will use L<Win32>::GetFolderPath to fetch the location
  of your directories. As a result of this, in certain unusual situations
  (usually found inside large organisations) the methods may return UNC paths
  such as C<\\cifs.local\home$>.
  
  If your application runs on Windows and you want to have it work comprehensively
  everywhere, you may need to implement your own handling for these paths as they
  can cause strange behaviour.
  
  For example, stat calls to UNC paths may work but block for several seconds, but
  opendir() may not be able to read any files (creating the appearance of an existing
  but empty directory).
  
  To avoid complicating the problem any further, in the rare situation that a UNC path
  is returned by C<GetFolderPath> the usual -d validation checks will B<not> be done.

  =head1 NAME
  
  File::Which - Portable implementation of the `which' utility
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use File::Which;                  # exports which()
    use File::Which qw(which where);  # exports which() and where()
    
    my $exe_path = which('perldoc');
    
    my @paths = where('perl');
    - Or -
    my @paths = which('perl'); # an array forces search for all of them
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<File::Which> was created to be able to get the paths to executable programs
  on systems under which the `which' program wasn't implemented in the shell.
  
  C<File::Which> searches the directories of the user's C<PATH> (as returned by
  C<File::Spec-E<gt>path()>), looking for executable files having the name
  specified as a parameter to C<which()>. Under Win32 systems, which do not have a
  notion of directly executable files, but uses special extensions such as C<.exe>
  and C<.bat> to identify them, C<File::Which> takes extra steps to assure that
  you will find the correct file (so for example, you might be searching for
  C<perl>, it'll try F<perl.exe>, F<perl.bat>, etc.)
  
  =head1 Steps Used on Win32, DOS, OS2 and VMS
  
  =head2 Windows NT
  
  Windows NT has a special environment variable called C<PATHEXT>, which is used
  by the shell to look for executable files. Usually, it will contain a list in
  the form C<.EXE;.BAT;.COM;.JS;.VBS> etc. If C<File::Which> finds such an
  environment variable, it parses the list and uses it as the different
  extensions.
  
  =head2 Windows 9x and other ancient Win/DOS/OS2
  
  This set of operating systems don't have the C<PATHEXT> variable, and usually
  you will find executable files there with the extensions C<.exe>, C<.bat> and
  (less likely) C<.com>. C<File::Which> uses this hardcoded list if it's running
  under Win32 but does not find a C<PATHEXT> variable.
  
  =head2 VMS
  
  Same case as Windows 9x: uses C<.exe> and C<.com> (in that order).
  
  =head1 Functions
  
  =head2 which($short_exe_name)
  
  Exported by default.
  
  C<$short_exe_name> is the name used in the shell to call the program (for
  example, C<perl>).
  
  If it finds an executable with the name you specified, C<which()> will return
  the absolute path leading to this executable (for example, F</usr/bin/perl> or
  F<C:\Perl\Bin\perl.exe>).
  
  If it does I<not> find the executable, it returns C<undef>.
  
  If C<which()> is called in list context, it will return I<all> the
  matches.
  
  =head2 where($short_exe_name)
  
  Not exported by default.
  
  Same as C<which($short_exe_name)> in array context. Same as the
  C<`where'> utility, will return an array containing all the path names
  matching C<$short_exe_name>.
  
  =head1 BUGS AND CAVEATS
  
  Not tested on VMS or MacOS, although there is platform specific code
  for those. Anyone who haves a second would be very kind to send me a
  report of how it went.
  
  File::Spec adds the current directory to the front of PATH if on
  Win32, VMS or MacOS. I have no knowledge of those so don't know if the
  current directory is searced first or not. Could someone please tell
  me?
  
  =head1 SUPPORT
  
  Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
  
  L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=File-Which>

  =head1 NAME
  
  File::chdir - a more sensible way to change directories
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.1008
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
     use File::chdir;
   
     $CWD = "/foo/bar";     # now in /foo/bar
     {
         local $CWD = "/moo/baz";  # now in /moo/baz
         ...
     }
   
     # still in /foo/bar!
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Perl's C<<< chdir() >>> has the unfortunate problem of being very, very, very
  global.  If any part of your program calls C<<< chdir() >>> or if any library
  you use calls C<<< chdir() >>>, it changes the current working directory for
  the B<whole> program.
  
  This sucks.
  
  File::chdir gives you an alternative, C<<< $CWD >>> and C<<< @CWD >>>.  These two
  variables combine all the power of C<<< chdir() >>>, L<File::Spec> and L<Cwd>.
  
  =head1 $CWD
  
  Use the C<<< $CWD >>> variable instead of C<<< chdir() >>> and Cwd.
  
       use File::chdir;
       $CWD = $dir;  # just like chdir($dir)!
       print $CWD;   # prints the current working directory
  
  It can be localized, and it does the right thing.
  
       $CWD = "/foo";      # it's /foo out here.
       {
           local $CWD = "/bar";  # /bar in here
       }
       # still /foo out here!
  
  C<<< $CWD >>> always returns the absolute path in the native form for the
  operating system.
  
  C<<< $CWD >>> and normal C<<< chdir() >>> work together just fine.
  
  =head1 @CWD
  
  C<<< @CWD >>> represents the current working directory as an array, each
  directory in the path is an element of the array.  This can often make
  the directory easier to manipulate, and you don't have to fumble with
  C<<< File::Spec->splitpath >>> and C<<< File::Spec->catdir >>> to make portable code.
  
     # Similar to chdir("/usr/local/src/perl")
     @CWD = qw(usr local src perl);
  
  pop, push, shift, unshift and splice all work.  pop and push are
  probably the most useful.
  
     pop @CWD;                 # same as chdir(File::Spec->updir)
     push @CWD, 'some_dir'     # same as chdir('some_dir')
  
  C<<< @CWD >>> and C<<< $CWD >>> both work fine together.
  
  B<NOTE> Due to a perl bug you can't localize C<<< @CWD >>>.  See L</CAVEATS> for a work around.
  
  =head1 EXAMPLES
  
  (We omit the C<<< use File::chdir >>> from these examples for terseness)
  
  Here's C<<< $CWD >>> instead of C<<< chdir() >>>:
  
       $CWD = 'foo';           # chdir('foo')
  
  and now instead of Cwd.
  
       print $CWD;             # use Cwd;  print Cwd::abs_path
  
  you can even do zsh style C<<< cd foo bar >>>
  
       $CWD = '/usr/local/foo';
       $CWD =~ s/usr/var/;
  
  if you want to localize that, make sure you get the parens right
  
       {
           (local $CWD) =~ s/usr/var/;
           ...
       }
  
  It's most useful for writing polite subroutines which don't leave the
  program in some strange directory:
  
       sub foo {
           local $CWD = 'some/other/dir';
           ...do your work...
       }
  
  which is much simpler than the equivalent:
  
       sub foo {
           use Cwd;
           my $orig_dir = Cwd::getcwd;
           chdir('some/other/dir');
   
           ...do your work...
   
           chdir($orig_dir);
       }
  
  C<<< @CWD >>> comes in handy when you want to start moving up and down the
  directory hierarchy in a cross-platform manner without having to use
  File::Spec.
  
       pop @CWD;                   # chdir(File::Spec->updir);
       push @CWD, 'some', 'dir'    # chdir(File::Spec->catdir(qw(some dir)));
  
  You can easily change your parent directory:
  
       # chdir from /some/dir/bar/moo to /some/dir/foo/moo
       $CWD[-2] = 'foo';
  
  =head1 CAVEATS
  
  =head3 C<<< local @CWD >>> does not work.
  
  C<<< local @CWD >>> will not localize C<<< @CWD >>>.  This is a bug in Perl, you
  can't localize tied arrays.  As a work around localizing $CWD will
  effectively localize @CWD.
  
       {
           local $CWD;
           pop @CWD;
           ...
       }
  
  =head3 Assigning to C<<< @CWD >>> calls C<<< chdir() >>> for each element
  
       @CWD = qw/a b c d/;
  
  Internally, Perl clears C<<< @CWD >>> and assigns each element in turn.  Thus, this
  code above will do this:
  
       chdir 'a';
       chdir 'a/b';
       chdir 'a/b/c';
       chdir 'a/b/c/d';
  
  Generally, avoid assigning to C<<< @CWD >>> and just use push and pop instead.
  
  =head3 Volumes not handled
  
  There is currently no way to change the current volume via File::chdir.
  
  =head1 NOTES
  
  C<<< $CWD >>> returns the current directory using native path separators, i.e. \
  on Win32.  This ensures that C<<< $CWD >>> will compare correctly with directories
  created using File::Spec.  For example:
  
       my $working_dir = File::Spec->catdir( $CWD, "foo" );
       $CWD = $working_dir;
       doing_stuff_might_chdir();
       is( $CWD, $working_dir, "back to original working_dir?" );
  
  Deleting the last item of C<<< @CWD >>> will act like a pop.  Deleting from the
  middle will throw an exception.
  
       delete @CWD[-1]; # OK
       delete @CWD[-2]; # Dies
  
  What should %CWD do?  Something with volumes?
  
       # chdir to C:\Program Files\Sierra\Half Life ?
       $CWD{C} = '\\Program Files\\Sierra\\Half Life';
  
  =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
  
  If an error is encountered when changing C<<< $CWD >>> or C<<< @CWD >>>, one of
  the following exceptions will be thrown:
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  I<Can't delete except at the end of @CWD>
  
  =item *
  
  I<Failed to change directory to '$dir'>
  
  =back
  
  =head1 HISTORY
  
  Michael wanted C<<< local chdir >>> to work.  p5p didn't.  But it wasn't over!
  Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?  Hell, no!
  
  Abigail andE<sol>or Bryan Warnock suggested the C<<< $CWD >>> thing (Michael forgets
  which).  They were right.
  
  The C<<< chdir() >>> override was eliminated in 0.04.
  
  David became co-maintainer with 0.06_01 to fix some chronic
  Win32 path bugs.
  
  As of 0.08, if changing C<<< $CWD >>> or C<<< @CWD >>> fails to change the directory, an
  error will be thrown.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module attempts to provide a small, fast utility for working with
  file paths.  It is friendlier to use than L<File::Spec> and provides
  easy access to functions from several other core file handling modules.
  
  It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as L<IO::All> or L<Path::Class>,
  nor does it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32 platforms.
  Even then, it might break if you try something particularly obscure or
  tortuous.  (Quick!  What does this mean: C<< ///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././ >>?
  And how does it differ on Win32?)
  
  All paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes.  Stringifying
  the object gives you back the path (after some clean up).
  
  File input/output methods C<flock> handles before reading or writing,
  as appropriate.
  
  The C<*_utf8> methods (C<slurp_utf8>, C<lines_utf8>, etc.) operate in raw
  mode without CRLF translation.  Installing L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58 or later
  will speed up several of them and is highly recommended.
  
  It uses L<autodie> internally, so most failures will be thrown as exceptions.
  
  =head1 CONSTRUCTORS
  
  =head2 path
  
      $path = path("foo/bar");
      $path = path("/tmp", "file.txt"); # list
      $path = path(".");                # cwd
      $path = path("~user/file.txt");   # tilde processing
  
  Constructs a C<Path::Tiny> object.  It doesn't matter if you give a file or
  directory path.  It's still up to you to call directory-like methods only on
  directories and file-like methods only on files.  This function is exported
  automatically by default.
  
  The first argument must be defined and have non-zero length or an exception
  will be thrown.  This prevents subtle, dangerous errors with code like
  C<< path( maybe_undef() )->remove_tree >>.
  
  If the first component of the path is a tilde ('~') then the component will be
  replaced with the output of C<glob('~')>.  If the first component of the path
  is a tilde followed by a user name then the component will be replaced with
  output of C<glob('~username')>.  Behaviour for non-existent users depends on
  the output of C<glob> on the system.
  
  =head2 new
  
      $path = Path::Tiny->new("foo/bar");
  
  This is just like C<path>, but with method call overhead.  (Why would you
  do that?)
  
  =head2 cwd
  
      $path = Path::Tiny->cwd; # path( Cwd::getcwd )
      $path = cwd; # optional export
  
  Gives you the absolute path to the current directory as a C<Path::Tiny> object.
  This is slightly faster than C<< path(".")->absolute >>.
  
  C<cwd> may be exported on request and used as a function instead of as a
  method.
  
  =head2 rootdir
  
      $path = Path::Tiny->rootdir; # /
      $path = rootdir;             # optional export 
  
  Gives you C<< File::Spec->rootdir >> as a C<Path::Tiny> object if you're too
  picky for C<path("/")>.
  
  C<rootdir> may be exported on request and used as a function instead of as a
  method.
  
  =head2 tempfile, tempdir
  
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile( @options );
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempdir( @options );
      $temp = tempfile( @options ); # optional export
      $temp = tempdir( @options );  # optional export
  
  C<tempfile> passes the options to C<< File::Temp->new >> and returns a C<Path::Tiny>
  object with the file name.  The C<TMPDIR> option is enabled by default.
  
  The resulting C<File::Temp> object is cached. When the C<Path::Tiny> object is
  destroyed, the C<File::Temp> object will be as well.
  
  C<File::Temp> annoyingly requires you to specify a custom template in slightly
  different ways depending on which function or method you call, but
  C<Path::Tiny> lets you ignore that and can take either a leading template or a
  C<TEMPLATE> option and does the right thing.
  
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile( "customXXXXXXXX" );             # ok
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile( TEMPLATE => "customXXXXXXXX" ); # ok
  
  The tempfile path object will normalized to have an absolute path, even if
  created in a relative directory using C<DIR>.
  
  C<tempdir> is just like C<tempfile>, except it calls
  C<< File::Temp->newdir >> instead.
  
  Both C<tempfile> and C<tempdir> may be exported on request and used as
  functions instead of as methods.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 absolute
  
      $abs = path("foo/bar")->absolute;
      $abs = path("foo/bar")->absolute("/tmp");
  
  Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object with an absolute path.  Unless
  an argument is given, the current directory is used as the absolute base path.
  The argument must be absolute or you won't get an absolute result.
  
  This will not resolve upward directories ("foo/../bar") unless C<canonpath>
  in L<File::Spec> would normally do so on your platform.  If you need them
  resolved, you must call the more expensive C<realpath> method instead.
  
  =head2 append, append_raw, append_utf8
  
      path("foo.txt")->append(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->append(\@data);
      path("foo.txt")->append({binmode => ":raw"}, @data);
      path("foo.txt")->append_raw(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->append_utf8(@data);
  
  Appends data to a file.  The file is locked with C<flock> prior to writing.  An
  optional hash reference may be used to pass options.  The only option is
  C<binmode>, which is passed to C<binmode()> on the handle used for writing.
  
  C<append_raw> is like C<append> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix> for fast,
  unbuffered, raw write.
  
  C<append_utf8> is like C<append> with a C<binmode> of
  C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>.  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw
  append will be done instead on the data encoded with C<Unicode::UTF8>.
  
  =head2 basename
  
      $name = path("foo/bar.txt")->basename; # bar.txt
  
  Returns the file portion or last directory portion of a path.
  
  =head2 canonpath
  
      $canonical = path("foo/bar")->canonpath; # foo\bar on Windows
  
  Returns a string with the canonical format of the path name for
  the platform.  In particular, this means directory separators
  will be C<\> on Windows.
  
  =head2 child
  
      $file = path("/tmp")->child("foo.txt"); # "/tmp/foo.txt"
      $file = path("/tmp")->child(@parts);
  
  Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object relative to the original.  Works
  like C<catfile> or C<catdir> from File::Spec, but without caring about
  file or directories.
  
  =head2 children
  
      @paths = path("/tmp")->children;
  
  Returns a list of C<Path::Tiny> objects for all file and directories
  within a directory.  Excludes "." and ".." automatically.
  
  =head2 copy
  
      path("/tmp/foo.txt")->copy("/tmp/bar.txt");
  
  Copies a file using L<File::Copy>'s C<copy> function.
  
  =head2 dirname
  
      $name = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->dirname; # "/tmp/"
  
  Returns the directory name portion of the path.  This is roughly
  equivalent to what L<File::Spec> would give from C<splitpath> and thus
  usually has the trailing slash. If that's not desired, stringify directories
  or call C<parent> on files.
  
  =head2 exists, is_file, is_dir
  
      if ( path("/tmp")->exists ) { ... }
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_file ) { ... }
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_dir ) { ... }
  
  Just like C<-e>, C<-f> or C<-d>.  This means the file or directory actually has to
  exist on the filesystem.  Until then, it's just a path.
  
  =head2 filehandle
  
      $fh = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->filehandle($mode, $binmode);
  
  Returns an open file handle.  The C<$mode> argument must be a Perl-style
  read/write mode string ("<" ,">", "<<", etc.).  If a C<$binmode>
  is given, it is set during the C<open> call.
  
  See C<openr>, C<openw>, C<openrw>, and C<opena> for sugar.
  
  =head2 is_absolute, is_relative
  
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_absolute ) { ... }
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_relative ) { ... }
  
  Booleans for whether the path appears absolute or relative.
  
  =head2 iterator
  
      $iter = path("/tmp")->iterator( \%options );
  
  Returns a code reference that walks a directory lazily.  Each invocation
  returns a C<Path::Tiny> object or undef when the iterator is exhausted.
  
      $iter = path("/tmp")->iterator;
      while ( $path = $iter->() ) {
          ...
      }
  
  The current and parent directory entries ("." and "..") will not
  be included.
  
  If the C<recurse> option is true, the iterator will walk the directory
  recursively, breadth-first.  If the C<follow_symlinks> option is also true,
  directory links will be followed recursively.  There is no protection against
  loops when following links.
  
  For a more powerful, recursive iterator with built-in loop avoidance, see
  L<Path::Iterator::Rule>.
  
  =head2 lines, lines_raw, lines_utf8
  
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines;
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines(\%options);
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines_raw;
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines_utf8;
  
  Returns a list of lines from a file.  Optionally takes a hash-reference of
  options.  Valid options are C<binmode>, C<count> and C<chomp>.  If C<binmode>
  is provided, it will be set on the handle prior to reading.  If C<count> is
  provided, up to that many lines will be returned. If C<chomp> is set, lines
  will be chomped before being returned.
  
  Because the return is a list, C<lines> in scalar context will return the number
  of lines (and throw away the data).
  
      $number_of_lines = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines;
  
  C<lines_raw> is like C<lines> with a C<binmode> of C<:raw>.  We use C<:raw>
  instead of C<:unix> so PerlIO buffering can manage reading by line.
  
  C<lines_utf8> is like C<lines> with a C<binmode> of
  C<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)>.  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw
  UTF-8 slurp will be done and then the lines will be split.  This is
  actually faster than relying on C<:encoding(UTF-8)>, though a bit memory
  intensive.  If memory use is a concern, consider C<openr_utf8> and
  iterating directly on the handle.
  
  =head2 mkpath
  
      path("foo/bar/baz")->mkpath;
      path("foo/bar/baz")->mkpath( \%options );
  
  Like calling C<make_path> from L<File::Path>.  An optional hash reference
  is passed through to C<make_path>.  Errors will be trapped and an exception
  thrown.  Returns the list of directories created or an empty list if
  the directories already exist, just like C<make_path>.
  
  =head2 move
  
      path("foo.txt")->move("bar.txt");
  
  Just like C<rename>.
  
  =head2 openr, openw, openrw, opena
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr($binmode);  # read
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr_utf8;
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw($binmode);  # write
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw_utf8;
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena($binmode);  # append
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena_utf8;
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw($binmode); # read/write
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw_utf8;
  
  Returns a file handle opened in the specified mode.  The C<openr> style methods
  take a single C<binmode> argument.  All of the C<open*> methods have
  C<open*_raw> and C<open*_utf8> equivalents that use C<:raw> and
  C<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)>, respectively.
  
  =head2 parent
  
      $parent = path("foo/bar/baz")->parent; # foo/bar
      $parent = path("foo/wibble.txt")->parent; # foo
  
      $parent = path("foo/bar/baz")->parent(2); # foo
  
  Returns a C<Path::Tiny> object corresponding to the parent directory of the
  original directory or file. An optional positive integer argument is the number
  of parent directories upwards to return.  C<parent> by itself is equivalent to
  C<parent(1)>.
  
  =head2 realpath
  
      $real = path("/baz/foo/../bar")->realpath;
      $real = path("foo/../bar")->realpath;
  
  Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object with all symbolic links and upward directory
  parts resolved using L<Cwd>'s C<realpath>.  Compared to C<absolute>, this is
  more expensive as it must actually consult the filesystem.
  
  =head2 relative
  
      $rel = path("/tmp/foo/bar")->relative("/tmp"); # foo/bar
  
  Returns a C<Path::Tiny> object with a relative path name.
  Given the trickiness of this, it's a thin wrapper around
  C<< File::Spec->abs2rel() >>.
  
  =head2 remove
  
      path("foo.txt")->remove;
  
  B<Note: as of 0.012, remove only works on files>.
  
  This is just like C<unlink>, except if the path does not exist, it returns
  false rather than throwing an exception.
  
  =head2 remove_tree
  
      # directory
      path("foo/bar/baz")->remove_tree;
      path("foo/bar/baz")->remove_tree( \%options );
      path("foo/bar/baz")->remove_tree( { safe => 0 } ); # force remove
  
  Like calling C<remove_tree> from L<File::Path>, but defaults to C<safe> mode.
  An optional hash reference is passed through to C<remove_tree>.  Errors will be
  trapped and an exception thrown.  Returns the number of directories deleted,
  just like C<remove_tree>.
  
  If you want to remove a directory only if it is empty, use the built-in
  C<rmdir> function instead.
  
      rmdir path("foo/bar/baz/");
  
  =head2 slurp, slurp_raw, slurp_utf8
  
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp;
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp( {binmode => ":raw"} );
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp_raw;
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp_utf8;
  
  Reads file contents into a scalar.  Takes an optional hash reference may be
  used to pass options.  The only option is C<binmode>, which is passed to
  C<binmode()> on the handle used for reading.
  
  C<slurp_raw> is like C<slurp> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix> for
  a fast, unbuffered, raw read.
  
  C<slurp_utf8> is like C<slurp> with a C<binmode> of
  C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>.  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw
  slurp will be done instead and the result decoded with C<Unicode::UTF8>.
  This is just as strict and is roughly an order of magnitude faster than
  using C<:encoding(UTF-8)>.
  
  =head2 spew, spew_raw, spew_utf8
  
      path("foo.txt")->spew(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew(\@data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew({binmode => ":raw"}, @data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew_raw(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew_utf8(@data);
  
  Writes data to a file atomically.  The file is written to a temporary file in
  the same directory, then renamed over the original.  An optional hash reference
  may be used to pass options.  The only option is C<binmode>, which is passed to
  C<binmode()> on the handle used for writing.
  
  C<spew_raw> is like C<spew> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix> for a fast,
  unbuffered, raw write.
  
  C<spew_utf8> is like C<spew> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>.
  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw spew will be done instead on
  the data encoded with C<Unicode::UTF8>.
  
  =head2 stat, lstat
  
      $stat = path("foo.txt")->stat;
      $stat = path("/some/symlink")->lstat;
  
  Like calling C<stat> or C<lstat> from L<File::stat>.
  
  =head2 stringify
  
      $path = path("foo.txt");
      say $path->stringify; # same as "$path"
  
  Returns a string representation of the path.  Unlike C<canonpath>, this method
  returns the path standardized with Unix-style C</> directory separators.
  
  =head2 touch
  
      path("foo.txt")->touch;
      path("foo.txt")->touch($epoch_secs);
  
  Like the Unix C<touch> utility.  Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or else
  changes the modification and access times to the current time.  If the first
  argument is the epoch seconds then it will be used.
  
  Returns the path object so it can be easily chained with spew:
  
      path("foo.txt")->touch->spew( $content );
  
  =head2 touchpath
  
      path("bar/baz/foo.txt")->touchpath;
  
  Combines C<mkpath> and C<touch>.  Creates the parent directory if it doesn't exist,
  before touching the file.  Returns the path object like C<touch> does.
  
  =head2 volume
  
      $vol = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->volume;
  
  Returns the volume portion of the path.  This is equivalent
  equivalent to what L<File::Spec> would give from C<splitpath> and thus
  usually is the empty string on Unix-like operating systems.
  
  =for Pod::Coverage openr_utf8 opena_utf8 openw_utf8 openrw_utf8
  openr_raw opena_raw openw_raw openrw_raw
  DOES
  
  =head1 CAVEATS
  
  =head2 utf8 vs UTF-8
  
  All the C<*_utf8> methods use C<:encoding(UTF-8)> -- either as
  C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)> (unbuffered) or C<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)> (buffered) --
  which is strict against the Unicode spec and disallows illegal Unicode
  codepoints or UTF-8 sequences.
  
  Unfortunately, C<:encoding(UTF-8)> is very, very slow.  If you install
  L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58 or later, that module will be used by some C<*_utf8>
  methods to encode or decode data after a raw, binary input/output operation,
  which is much faster.
  
  If you need the performance and can accept the security risk,
  C<< slurp({binmode => ":unix:utf8"}) >> will be faster than C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>
  (but not as fast as C<Unicode::UTF8>).
  
  Note that the C<*_utf8> methods read in B<raw> mode.  There is no CRLF
  translation on Windows.  If you must have CRLF translation, use the regular
  input/output methods with an appropriate binmode:
  
    $path->spew_utf8($data);                            # raw
    $path->spew({binmode => ":encoding(UTF-8)"}, $data; # LF -> CRLF
  
  Consider L<PerlIO::utf8_strict> for a faster L<PerlIO> layer alternative to
  C<:encoding(UTF-8)>, though it does not appear to be as fast as the
  C<Unicode::UTF8> approach.
  
  =head2 Default IO layers and the open pragma
  
  If you have Perl 5.10 or later, file input/output methods (C<slurp>, C<spew>,
  etc.) and high-level handle opening methods ( C<openr>, C<openw>, etc. but not
  C<filehandle>) respect default encodings set by the C<-C> switch or lexical
  L<open> settings of the caller.  For UTF-8, this is almost certainly slower
  than using the dedicated C<_utf8> methods if you have L<Unicode::UTF8>.
  
  =head1 TYPE CONSTRAINTS AND COERCION
  
  A standard L<MooseX::Types> library is available at
  L<MooseX::Types::Path::Tiny>.
  
  =head1 SEE ALSO
  
  These are other file/path utilities, which may offer a different feature
  set than C<Path::Tiny>.
  
  * L<File::Fu>
  * L<IO::All>
  * L<Path::Class>
  
  These iterators may be slightly faster than the recursive iterator in
  C<Path::Tiny>:
  
  * L<Path::Iterator::Rule>
  * L<File::Next>
  
  There are probably comparable, non-Tiny tools.  Let me know if you want me to
  add a module to the list.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Sort::Naturally -- sort lexically, but sort numeral parts numerically
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    @them = nsort(qw(
     foo12a foo12z foo13a foo 14 9x foo12 fooa foolio Foolio Foo12a
    ));
    print join(' ', @them), "\n";
  
  Prints:
  
    9x 14 foo fooa foolio Foolio foo12 foo12a Foo12a foo12z foo13a
  
  (Or "foo12a" + "Foo12a" and "foolio" + "Foolio" and might be
  switched, depending on your locale.)
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module exports two functions, C<nsort> and C<ncmp>; they are used
  in implementing my idea of a "natural sorting" algorithm.  Under natural
  sorting, numeric substrings are compared numerically, and other
  word-characters are compared lexically.
  
  This is the way I define natural sorting:
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  Non-numeric word-character substrings are sorted lexically,
  case-insensitively: "Foo" comes between "fish" and "fowl".
  
  =item *
  
  Numeric substrings are sorted numerically:
  "100" comes after "20", not before.
  
  =item *
  
  \W substrings (neither words-characters nor digits) are I<ignored>.
  
  =item *
  
  Our use of \w, \d, \D, and \W is locale-sensitive:  Sort::Naturally
  uses a C<use locale> statement.
  
  =item *
  
  When comparing two strings, where a numeric substring in one
  place is I<not> up against a numeric substring in another,
  the non-numeric always comes first.  This is fudged by
  reading pretending that the lack of a number substring has
  the value -1, like so:
  
    foo       =>  "foo",  -1
    foobar    =>  "foo",  -1,  "bar"
    foo13     =>  "foo",  13,
    foo13xyz  =>  "foo",  13,  "xyz"
  
  That's so that "foo" will come before "foo13", which will come
  before "foobar".
  
  =item *
  
  The start of a string is exceptional: leading non-\W (non-word,
  non-digit)
  components are are ignored, and numbers come I<before> letters.
  
  =item *
  
  I define "numeric substring" just as sequences matching m/\d+/ --
  scientific notation, commas, decimals, etc., are not seen.  If
  your data has thousands separators in numbers
  ("20,000 Leagues Under The Sea" or "20.000 lieues sous les mers"),
  consider stripping them before feeding them to C<nsort> or
  C<ncmp>.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 The nsort function
  
  This function takes a list of strings, and returns a copy of the list,
  sorted.
  
  This is what most people will want to use:
  
    @stuff = nsort(...list...);
  
  When nsort needs to compare non-numeric substrings, it
  uses Perl's C<lc> function in scope of a <use locale>.
  And when nsort needs to lowercase things, it uses Perl's
  C<lc> function in scope of a <use locale>.  If you want nsort
  to use other functions instead, you can specify them in
  an arrayref as the first argument to nsort:
  
    @stuff = nsort( [
                      \&string_comparator,   # optional
                      \&lowercaser_function  # optional
                    ],
                    ...list...
                  );
  
  If you want to specify a string comparator but no lowercaser,
  then the options list is C<[\&comparator, '']> or
  C<[\&comparator]>.  If you want to specify no string comparator
  but a lowercaser, then the options list is
  C<['', \&lowercaser]>.
  
  Any comparator you specify is called as
  C<$comparator-E<gt>($left, $right)>,
  and, like a normal Perl C<cmp> replacement, must return
  -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the left argument is stringwise
  less than, equal to, or greater than the right argument.
  
  Any lowercaser function you specify is called as
  C<$lowercased = $lowercaser-E<gt>($original)>.  The routine
  must not modify its C<$_[0]>.
  
  =head2 The ncmp function
  
  Often, when sorting non-string values like this:
  
     @objects_sorted = sort { $a->tag cmp $b->tag } @objects;
  
  ...or even in a Schwartzian transform, like this:
  
     @strings =
       map $_->[0]
       sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }
       map { [$_, make_a_sort_key_from($_) ]
       @_
     ;
  
  ...you wight want something that replaces not C<sort>, but C<cmp>.
  That's what Sort::Naturally's C<ncmp> function is for.  Call it with
  the syntax C<ncmp($left,$right)> instead of C<$left cmp $right>,
  but otherwise it's a fine replacement:
  
     @objects_sorted = sort { ncmp($a->tag,$b->tag) } @objects;
  
     @strings =
       map $_->[0]
       sort { ncmp($a->[1], $b->[1]) }
       map { [$_, make_a_sort_key_from($_) ]
       @_
     ;
  
  Just as with C<nsort> can take different a string-comparator
  and/or lowercaser, you can do the same with C<ncmp>, by passing
  an arrayref as the first argument:
  
    ncmp( [
            \&string_comparator,   # optional
            \&lowercaser_function  # optional
          ],
          $left, $right
        )
  
  You might get string comparators from L<Sort::ArbBiLex|Sort::ArbBiLex>.
  
  =head1 NOTES
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  This module is not a substitute for
  L<Sort::Versions|Sort::Versions>!  If
  you just need proper version sorting, use I<that!>
  
  =item *
  
  If you need something that works I<sort of> like this module's
  functions, but not quite the same, consider scouting thru this
  module's source code, and adapting what you see.  Besides
  the functions that actually compile in this module, after the POD,
  there's several alternate attempts of mine at natural sorting
  routines, which are not compiled as part of the module, but which you
  might find useful.  They should all be I<working> implementations of
  slightly different algorithms
  (all of them based on Martin Pool's C<nsort>) which I eventually
  discarded in favor of my algorithm.  If you are having to
  naturally-sort I<very large> data sets, and sorting is getting
  ridiculously slow, you might consider trying one of those
  discarded functions -- I have a feeling they might be faster on
  large data sets.  Benchmark them on your data and see.  (Unless
  you I<need> the speed, don't bother.  Hint: substitute C<sort>
  for C<nsort> in your code, and unless your program speeds up
  drastically, it's not the sorting that's slowing things down.
  But if it I<is> C<nsort> that's slowing things down, consider
  just:
  
        if(@set >= SOME_VERY_BIG_NUMBER) {
          no locale; # vroom vroom
          @sorted = sort(@set);  # feh, good enough
        } elsif(@set >= SOME_BIG_NUMBER) {
          use locale;
          @sorted = sort(@set);  # feh, good enough
        } else {
          # but keep it pretty for normal cases
          @sorted = nsort(@set);
        }
  
  =item *
  
  If you do adapt the routines in this module, email me; I'd
  just be interested in hearing about it.
  
  =item *
  
  Thanks to the EFNet #perl people for encouraging this module,
  especially magister and a-mused.

  =head1 NAME
  
  YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language (tm)
  
  =head1 NOTE
  
  This module has been released to CPAN as YAML::Old, and soon YAML.pm
  will be changed to just be a frontend interface module for all the
  various Perl YAML implementation modules, including YAML::Old.
  
  If you want robust and fast YAML processing using the normal Dump/Load
  API, please consider switching to YAML::XS. It is by far the best Perl
  module for YAML at this time. It requires that you have a C compiler,
  since it is written in C.
  
  If you really need to use this version of YAML.pm it will always be
  available as YAML::Old.
  
  If you don't care which YAML module use, as long as it's the best one
  installed on your system, use YAML::Any.
  
  The rest of this documentation is left unchanged, until YAML.pm is
  switched over to the new UI-only version.

      You probably think YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". It
      ain't! YAML is really a data serialization language. But if you want
      to think of it as a markup, that's OK with me. A lot of people try
      to use XML as a serialization format.
      
      "YAML" is catchy and fun to say. Try it. "YAML, YAML, YAML!!!"
      ...
      
      # Dump the Perl data structures back into YAML.
      print Dump($string, $arrayref, $hashref);
      
      # YAML::Dump is used the same way you'd use Data::Dumper::Dumper
      use Data::Dumper;
      print Dumper($string, $arrayref, $hashref);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  The YAML.pm module implements a YAML Loader and Dumper based on the YAML
  1.0 specification. L<http://www.yaml.org/spec/>
  
  YAML is a generic data serialization language that is optimized for
  human readability. It can be used to express the data structures of most
  modern programming languages. (Including Perl!!!)
  
  For information on the YAML syntax, please refer to the YAML
  specification.
  
  =head1 WHY YAML IS COOL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item YAML is readable for people.
  
  It makes clear sense out of complex data structures. You should find
  that YAML is an exceptional data dumping tool. Structure is shown
  through indentation, YAML supports recursive data, and hash keys are
  sorted by default. In addition, YAML supports several styles of scalar
  formatting for different types of data.
  
  =item YAML is editable.
  
  YAML was designed from the ground up to be an excellent syntax for
  configuration files. Almost all programs need configuration files, so
  why invent a new syntax for each one? And why subject users to the
  complexities of XML or native Perl code?
  
  =item YAML is multilingual.
  
  Yes, YAML supports Unicode. But I'm actually referring to programming
  languages. YAML was designed to meet the serialization needs of Perl,
  Python, Ruby, Tcl, PHP, Javascript and Java. It was also designed to be
  interoperable between those languages. That means YAML serializations
  produced by Perl can be processed by Python.
  
  =item YAML is taint safe.
  
  Using modules like Data::Dumper for serialization is fine as long as you
  can be sure that nobody can tamper with your data files or
  transmissions. That's because you need to use Perl's C<eval()> built-in
  to deserialize the data. Somebody could add a snippet of Perl to erase
  your files.
  
  YAML's parser does not need to eval anything.
  
  =item YAML is full featured.
  
  YAML can accurately serialize all of the common Perl data structures and
  deserialize them again without losing data relationships. Although it is
  not 100% perfect (no serializer is or can be perfect), it fares as well
  as the popular current modules: Data::Dumper, Storable, XML::Dumper and
  Data::Denter.
  
  YAML.pm also has the ability to handle code (subroutine) references and
  typeglobs. (Still experimental) These features are not found in Perl's
  other serialization modules.
  
  =item YAML is extensible.
  
  The YAML language has been designed to be flexible enough to solve it's
  own problems. The markup itself has 3 basic construct which resemble
  Perl's hash, array and scalar. By default, these map to their Perl
  equivalents. But each YAML node also supports a tagging mechanism (type
  system) which can cause that node to be interpreted in a completely
  different manner. That's how YAML can support object serialization and
  oddball structures like Perl's typeglob.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 YAML IMPLEMENTATIONS IN PERL
  
  This module, YAML.pm, is really just the interface module for YAML
  modules written in Perl. The basic interface for YAML consists of two
  functions: C<Dump> and C<Load>. The real work is done by the modules
  YAML::Dumper and YAML::Loader.
  
  Different YAML module distributions can be created by subclassing
  YAML.pm and YAML::Loader and YAML::Dumper. For example, YAML-Simple
  consists of YAML::Simple YAML::Dumper::Simple and YAML::Loader::Simple.
  
  Why would there be more than one implementation of YAML? Well, despite
  YAML's offering of being a simple data format, YAML is actually very
  deep and complex. Implementing the entirety of the YAML specification is
  a daunting task.
  
  For this reason I am currently working on 3 different YAML implementations.
  
  =over
  
  =item YAML
  
  The main YAML distribution will keeping evolving to support the entire
  YAML specification in pure Perl. This may not be the fastest or most
  stable module though. Currently, YAML.pm has lots of known bugs. It is
  mostly a great tool for dumping Perl data structures to a readable form.
  
  =item YAML::Tiny
  
  The point of YAML::Tiny is to strip YAML down to the 90% that people
  use most and offer that in a small, fast, stable, pure Perl form.
  YAML::Tiny will simply die when it is asked to do something it can't.
  
  =item YAML::Syck
  
  C<libsyck> is the C based YAML processing library used by the Ruby
  programming language (and also Python, PHP and Pugs). YAML::Syck is the
  Perl binding to C<libsyck>. It should be very fast, but may have
  problems of its own. It will also require C compilation.
  
  NOTE: Audrey Tang has actually completed this module and it works great
        and is 10 times faster than YAML.pm.
  
  =back
  
  In the future, there will likely be even more YAML modules. Remember,
  people other than Ingy are allowed to write YAML modules!
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL USAGE
  
  YAML is completely OO under the hood. Still it exports a few useful top
  level functions so that it is dead simple to use. These functions just
  do the OO stuff for you. If you want direct access to the OO API see the
  documentation for YAML::Dumper and YAML::Loader.
  
  =head2 Exported Functions
  
  The following functions are exported by YAML.pm by default. The reason
  they are exported is so that YAML works much like Data::Dumper. If you
  don't want functions to be imported, just use YAML with an empty
  import list:
  
      use YAML ();
  
  =over 4
  
  =item Dump(list-of-Perl-data-structures)
  
  Turn Perl data into YAML. This function works very much like
  Data::Dumper::Dumper(). It takes a list of Perl data strucures and
  dumps them into a serialized form. It returns a string containing the
  YAML stream. The structures can be references or plain scalars.
  
  =item Load(string-containing-a-YAML-stream)
  
  Turn YAML into Perl data. This is the opposite of Dump. Just like
  Storable's thaw() function or the eval() function in relation to
  Data::Dumper. It parses a string containing a valid YAML stream into a
  list of Perl data structures.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Exportable Functions
  
  These functions are not exported by default but you can request them in
  an import list like this:
  
      use YAML qw'freeze thaw Bless';
  
  =over 4
  
  =item freeze() and thaw()
  
  Aliases to Dump() and Load() for Storable fans. This will also allow
  YAML.pm to be plugged directly into modules like POE.pm, that use the
  freeze/thaw API for internal serialization.
  
  =item DumpFile(filepath, list)
  
  Writes the YAML stream to a file instead of just returning a string.
  
  =item LoadFile(filepath)
  
  Reads the YAML stream from a file instead of a string.
  
  =item Bless(perl-node, [yaml-node | class-name])
  
  Associate a normal Perl node, with a yaml node. A yaml node is an object
  tied to the YAML::Node class. The second argument is either a yaml node
  that you've already created or a class (package) name that supports a
  yaml_dump() function. A yaml_dump() function should take a perl node and
  return a yaml node. If no second argument is provided, Bless will create
  a yaml node. This node is not returned, but can be retrieved with the
  Blessed() function.
  
  Here's an example of how to use Bless. Say you have a hash containing
  three keys, but you only want to dump two of them. Furthermore the keys
  must be dumped in a certain order. Here's how you do that:
  
      use YAML qw(Dump Bless);
      $hash = {apple => 'good', banana => 'bad', cauliflower => 'ugly'};
      print Dump $hash;
      Bless($hash)->keys(['banana', 'apple']);
      print Dump $hash;
  
  produces:
  
      ---
      apple: good
      banana: bad
      cauliflower: ugly
      ---
      banana: bad
      apple: good
  
  Bless returns the tied part of a yaml-node, so that you can call the
  YAML::Node methods. This is the same thing that YAML::Node::ynode()
  returns. So another way to do the above example is:
  
      use YAML qw(Dump Bless);
      use YAML::Node;
      $hash = {apple => 'good', banana => 'bad', cauliflower => 'ugly'};
      print Dump $hash;
      Bless($hash);
      $ynode = ynode(Blessed($hash));
      $ynode->keys(['banana', 'apple']);
      print Dump $hash;
  
  Note that Blessing a Perl data structure does not change it anyway. The
  extra information is stored separately and looked up by the Blessed
  node's memory address.
  
  =item Blessed(perl-node)
  
  Returns the yaml node that a particular perl node is associated with
  (see above). Returns undef if the node is not (YAML) Blessed.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS
  
  YAML options are set using a group of global variables in the YAML
  namespace. This is similar to how Data::Dumper works.
  
  For example, to change the indentation width, do something like:
  
      local $YAML::Indent = 3;
  
  The current options are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item DumperClass
  
  You can override which module/class YAML uses for Dumping data.
  
  =item LoaderClass
  
  You can override which module/class YAML uses for Loading data.
  
  =item Indent
  
  This is the number of space characters to use for each indentation level
  when doing a Dump(). The default is 2.
  
  By the way, YAML can use any number of characters for indentation at any
  level. So if you are editing YAML by hand feel free to do it anyway that
  looks pleasing to you; just be consistent for a given level.
  
  =item SortKeys
  
  Default is 1. (true)
  
  Tells YAML.pm whether or not to sort hash keys when storing a document.
  
  YAML::Node objects can have their own sort order, which is usually what
  you want. To override the YAML::Node order and sort the keys anyway, set
  SortKeys to 2.
  
  =item Stringify
  
  Default is 0. (false)
  
  Objects with string overloading should honor the overloading and dump the
  stringification of themselves, rather than the actual object's guts.
  
  =item UseHeader
  
  Default is 1. (true)
  
  This tells YAML.pm whether to use a separator string for a Dump
  operation. This only applies to the first document in a stream.
  Subsequent documents must have a YAML header by definition.
  
  =item UseVersion
  
  Default is 0. (false)
  
  Tells YAML.pm whether to include the YAML version on the
  separator/header.
  
      --- %YAML:1.0
  
  =item AnchorPrefix
  
  Default is ''.
  
  Anchor names are normally numeric. YAML.pm simply starts with '1' and
  increases by one for each new anchor. This option allows you to specify a
  string to be prepended to each anchor number.
  
  =item UseCode
  
  Setting the UseCode option is a shortcut to set both the DumpCode and
  LoadCode options at once. Setting UseCode to '1' tells YAML.pm to dump
  Perl code references as Perl (using B::Deparse) and to load them back
  into memory using eval(). The reason this has to be an option is that
  using eval() to parse untrusted code is, well, untrustworthy.
  
  =item DumpCode
  
  Determines if and how YAML.pm should serialize Perl code references. By
  default YAML.pm will dump code references as dummy placeholders (much
  like Data::Dumper). If DumpCode is set to '1' or 'deparse', code
  references will be dumped as actual Perl code.
  
  DumpCode can also be set to a subroutine reference so that you can
  write your own serializing routine. YAML.pm passes you the code ref. You
  pass back the serialization (as a string) and a format indicator. The
  format indicator is a simple string like: 'deparse' or 'bytecode'.
  
  =item LoadCode
  
  LoadCode is the opposite of DumpCode. It tells YAML if and how to
  deserialize code references. When set to '1' or 'deparse' it will use
  C<eval()>. Since this is potentially risky, only use this option if you
  know where your YAML has been.
  
  LoadCode can also be set to a subroutine reference so that you can write
  your own deserializing routine. YAML.pm passes the serialization (as a
  string) and a format indicator. You pass back the code reference.
  
  =item UseBlock
  
  YAML.pm uses heuristics to guess which scalar style is best for a given
  node. Sometimes you'll want all multiline scalars to use the 'block'
  style. If so, set this option to 1.
  
  NOTE: YAML's block style is akin to Perl's here-document.
  
  =item UseFold
  
  If you want to force YAML to use the 'folded' style for all multiline
  scalars, then set $UseFold to 1.
  
  NOTE: YAML's folded style is akin to the way HTML folds text,
        except smarter.
  
  =item UseAliases
  
  YAML has an alias mechanism such that any given structure in memory gets
  serialized once. Any other references to that structure are serialized
  only as alias markers. This is how YAML can serialize duplicate and
  recursive structures.
  
  Sometimes, when you KNOW that your data is nonrecursive in nature, you
  may want to serialize such that every node is expressed in full. (ie as
  a copy of the original). Setting $YAML::UseAliases to 0 will allow you
  to do this. This also may result in faster processing because the lookup
  overhead is by bypassed.
  
  THIS OPTION CAN BE DANGEROUS. *If* your data is recursive, this option
  *will* cause Dump() to run in an endless loop, chewing up your computers
  memory. You have been warned.
  
  =item CompressSeries
  
  Default is 1.
  
  Compresses the formatting of arrays of hashes:
  
      -
        foo: bar
      - 
        bar: foo
  
  becomes:
  
      - foo: bar
      - bar: foo
  
  Since this output is usually more desirable, this option is turned on by
  default.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 YAML TERMINOLOGY
  
  YAML is a full featured data serialization language, and thus has its
  own terminology.
  
  It is important to remember that although YAML is heavily influenced by
  Perl and Python, it is a language in its own right, not merely just a
  representation of Perl structures.
  
  YAML has three constructs that are conspicuously similar to Perl's hash,
  array, and scalar. They are called mapping, sequence, and string
  respectively. By default, they do what you would expect. But each
  instance may have an explicit or implicit tag (type) that makes it
  behave differently. In this manner, YAML can be extended to represent
  Perl's Glob or Python's tuple, or Ruby's Bigint.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item stream
  
  A YAML stream is the full sequence of unicode characters that a YAML
  parser would read or a YAML emitter would write. A stream may contain
  one or more YAML documents separated by YAML headers.
  
      ---
      a: mapping
      foo: bar
      ---
      - a
      - sequence
  
  =item document
  
  A YAML document is an independent data structure representation within a
  stream. It is a top level node. Each document in a YAML stream must
  begin with a YAML header line. Actually the header is optional on the
  first document.
  
      ---
      This: top level mapping
      is:
          - a
          - YAML
          - document
  
  =item header
  
  A YAML header is a line that begins a YAML document. It consists of
  three dashes, possibly followed by more info. Another purpose of the
  header line is that it serves as a place to put top level tag and anchor
  information.
  
      --- !recursive-sequence &001
      - * 001
      - * 001
  
  =item node
  
  A YAML node is the representation of a particular data stucture. Nodes
  may contain other nodes. (In Perl terms, nodes are like scalars.
  Strings, arrayrefs and hashrefs. But this refers to the serialized
  format, not the in-memory structure.)
  
  =item tag
  
  This is similar to a type. It indicates how a particular YAML node
  serialization should be transferred into or out of memory. For instance
  a Foo::Bar object would use the tag 'perl/Foo::Bar':
  
      - !perl/Foo::Bar
          foo: 42
          bar: stool
  
  =item collection
  
  A collection is the generic term for a YAML data grouping. YAML has two
  types of collections: mappings and sequences. (Similar to hashes and arrays)
  
  =item mapping
  
  A mapping is a YAML collection defined by unordered key/value pairs with
  unique keys. By default YAML mappings are loaded into Perl hashes.
  
      a mapping:
          foo: bar
          two: times two is 4
  
  =item sequence
  
  A sequence is a YAML collection defined by an ordered list of elements. By
  default YAML sequences are loaded into Perl arrays.
  
      a sequence:
          - one bourbon
          - one scotch
          - one beer
  
  =item scalar
  
  A scalar is a YAML node that is a single value. By default YAML scalars
  are loaded into Perl scalars.
  
      a scalar key: a scalar value
  
  YAML has many styles for representing scalars. This is important because
  varying data will have varying formatting requirements to retain the
  optimum human readability.
  
  =item plain scalar
  
  A plain scalar is unquoted. All plain scalars are automatic candidates
  for "implicit tagging". This means that their tag may be determined
  automatically by examination. The typical uses for this are plain alpha
  strings, integers, real numbers, dates, times and currency.
  
      - a plain string
      - -42
      - 3.1415
      - 12:34
      - 123 this is an error
  
  =item single quoted scalar
  
  This is similar to Perl's use of single quotes. It means no escaping
  except for single quotes which are escaped by using two adjacent
  single quotes.
  
      - 'When I say ''\n'' I mean "backslash en"'
  
  =item double quoted scalar
  
  This is similar to Perl's use of double quotes. Character escaping can
  be used.
  
      - "This scalar\nhas two lines, and a bell -->\a"
  
  =item folded scalar
  
  This is a multiline scalar which begins on the next line. It is
  indicated by a single right angle bracket. It is unescaped like the
  single quoted scalar. Line folding is also performed.
  
      - > 
       This is a multiline scalar which begins on
       the next line. It is indicated by a single
       carat. It is unescaped like the single
       quoted scalar. Line folding is also
       performed.
  
  =item block scalar
  
  This final multiline form is akin to Perl's here-document except that
  (as in all YAML data) scope is indicated by indentation. Therefore, no
  ending marker is required. The data is verbatim. No line folding.

            2  Bar Belles    $29.95 $59.90
  
  =item parser
  
  A YAML processor has four stages: parse, load, dump, emit.
  
  A parser parses a YAML stream. YAML.pm's Load() function contains a
  parser.
  
  =item loader
  
  The other half of the Load() function is a loader. This takes the
  information from the parser and loads it into a Perl data structure.
  
  =item dumper
  
  The Dump() function consists of a dumper and an emitter. The dumper
  walks through each Perl data structure and gives info to the emitter.
  
  =item emitter
  
  The emitter takes info from the dumper and turns it into a YAML stream.
  
  NOTE:
  In YAML.pm the parser/loader and the dumper/emitter code are currently
  very closely tied together. In the future they may be broken into
  separate stages.
  
  =back
  
  For more information please refer to the immensely helpful YAML
  specification available at L<http://www.yaml.org/spec/>.
  
  =head1 ysh - The YAML Shell
  
  The YAML distribution ships with a script called 'ysh', the YAML shell.
  ysh provides a simple, interactive way to play with YAML. If you type in
  Perl code, it displays the result in YAML. If you type in YAML it turns
  it into Perl code.
  
  To run ysh, (assuming you installed it along with YAML.pm) simply type:
  
      ysh [options]
  
  Please read the C<ysh> documentation for the full details. There are
  lots of options.
  
  =head1 BUGS & DEFICIENCIES
  
  If you find a bug in YAML, please try to recreate it in the YAML Shell
  with logging turned on ('ysh -L'). When you have successfully reproduced
  the bug, please mail the LOG file to the author (ingy@cpan.org).
  
  WARNING: This is still *ALPHA* code. Well, most of this code has been
  around for years...
  
  BIGGER WARNING: YAML.pm has been slow in the making, but I am committed
  to having top notch YAML tools in the Perl world. The YAML team is close
  to finalizing the YAML 1.1 spec. This version of YAML.pm is based off of
  a very old pre 1.0 spec. In actuality there isn't a ton of difference,
  and this YAML.pm is still fairly useful. Things will get much better in
  the future.

  =head1 NAME
  
  YAML::Any - Pick a YAML implementation and use it.
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use YAML::Any;
      $YAML::Indent = 3;
      my $yaml = Dump(@objects);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  There are several YAML implementations that support the Dump/Load API.
  This module selects the best one available and uses it.
  
  =head1 ORDER
  
  Currently, YAML::Any will choose the first one of these YAML
  implementations that is installed on your system:
  
      YAML::XS
      YAML::Syck
      YAML::Old
      YAML
      YAML::Tiny
  
  =head1 OPTIONS
  
  If you specify an option like:
  
      $YAML::Indent = 4;
  
  And YAML::Any is using YAML::XS, it will use the proper variable:
  $YAML::XS::Indent.
  
  =head1 SUBROUTINES
  
  Like all the YAML modules that YAML::Any uses, the following subroutines
  are exported by default:
  
      Dump
      Load
  
  and the following subroutines are exportable by request:
  
      DumpFile
      LoadFile
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  YAML::Any provides the following class methods.
  
  =over
  
  =item YAML::Any->order;
  
  This method returns a list of the current possible implementations that
  YAML::Any will search for.
  
  =item YAML::Any->implementation;
  
  This method returns the implementation the YAML::Any will use. This
  result is obtained by finding the first member of YAML::Any->order that
  is either already loaded in C<%INC> or that can be loaded using
  C<require>. If no implementation is found, an error will be thrown.

  =head1 NAME
  
  YAML::Node - A generic data node that encapsulates YAML information
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use YAML;
      use YAML::Node;
      
      my $ynode = YAML::Node->new({}, 'ingerson.com/fruit');
      %$ynode = qw(orange orange apple red grape green);
      print Dump $ynode;
  
  yields:
  
      --- !ingerson.com/fruit
      orange: orange
      apple: red
      grape: green
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  A generic node in YAML is similar to a plain hash, array, or scalar node
  in Perl except that it must also keep track of its type. The type is a
  URI called the YAML type tag.
  
  YAML::Node is a class for generating and manipulating these containers.
  A YAML node (or ynode) is a tied hash, array or scalar. In most ways it
  behaves just like the plain thing. But you can assign and retrieve and
  YAML type tag URI to it. For the hash flavor, you can also assign the
  order that the keys will be retrieved in. By default a ynode will offer
  its keys in the same order that they were assigned.
  
  YAML::Node has a class method call new() that will return a ynode. You
  pass it a regular node and an optional type tag. After that you can
  use it like a normal Perl node, but when you YAML::Dump it, the magical
  properties will be honored.
  
  This is how you can control the sort order of hash keys during a YAML
  serialization. By default, YAML sorts keys alphabetically. But notice
  in the above example that the keys were Dumped in the same order they
  were assigned.
  
  YAML::Node exports a function called ynode(). This function returns the tied object so that you can call special methods on it like ->keys().
  
  keys() works like this:
  
      use YAML;
      use YAML::Node;
      
      %$node = qw(orange orange apple red grape green);
      $ynode = YAML::Node->new($node);
      ynode($ynode)->keys(['grape', 'apple']);
      print Dump $ynode;
  
  produces:
  
      ---
      grape: green
      apple: red
  
  It tells the ynode which keys and what order to use.
  
  ynodes will play a very important role in how programs use YAML. They
  are the foundation of how a Perl class can marshall the Loading and
  Dumping of its objects.
  
  The upcoming versions of YAML.pm will have much more information on this.

  The autodie pragma uses an updated version of Fatal to do its
  heavy lifting.  We seem to have loaded Fatal version %s, which is
  probably the version that came with your version of Perl.  However
  autodie needs version %s, which would have come bundled with
  autodie.
  
  You may be able to solve this problem by adding the following
  line of code to your main program, before any use of Fatal or
  autodie.
  
      use lib "%s";

  # try to compile the rest of our code, lest we use a constant

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
          bIlujDI' yIchegh()Qo'; yIHegh()!
  
          It is better to die() than to return() in failure.
  
                  -- Klingon programming proverb.
  
  The C<autodie> pragma provides a convenient way to replace functions
  that normally return false on failure with equivalents that throw
  an exception on failure.
  
  The C<autodie> pragma has I<lexical scope>, meaning that functions
  and subroutines altered with C<autodie> will only change their behaviour
  until the end of the enclosing block, file, or C<eval>.
  
  If C<system> is specified as an argument to C<autodie>, then it
  uses L<IPC::System::Simple> to do the heavy lifting.  See the
  description of that module for more information.
  
  =head1 EXCEPTIONS
  
  Exceptions produced by the C<autodie> pragma are members of the
  L<autodie::exception> class.  The preferred way to work with
  these exceptions under Perl 5.10 is as follows:
  
      use feature qw(switch);
  
      eval {
          use autodie;
  
          open(my $fh, '<', $some_file);
  
          my @records = <$fh>;
  
          # Do things with @records...
  
          close($fh);
  
      };
  
      given ($@) {
          when (undef)   { say "No error";                    }
          when ('open')  { say "Error from open";             }
          when (':io')   { say "Non-open, IO error.";         }
          when (':all')  { say "All other autodie errors."    }
          default        { say "Not an autodie error at all." }
      }
  
  Under Perl 5.8, the C<given/when> structure is not available, so the
  following structure may be used:
  
      eval {
          use autodie;
  
          open(my $fh, '<', $some_file);
  
          my @records = <$fh>;
  
          # Do things with @records...
  
          close($fh);
      };
  
      if ($@ and $@->isa('autodie::exception')) {
          if ($@->matches('open')) { print "Error from open\n";   }
          if ($@->matches(':io' )) { print "Non-open, IO error."; }
      } elsif ($@) {
          # A non-autodie exception.
      }
  
  See L<autodie::exception> for further information on interrogating
  exceptions.
  
  =head1 CATEGORIES
  
  Autodie uses a simple set of categories to group together similar
  built-ins.  Requesting a category type (starting with a colon) will
  enable autodie for all built-ins beneath that category.  For example,
  requesting C<:file> will enable autodie for C<close>, C<fcntl>,
  C<fileno>, C<open> and C<sysopen>.
  
  The categories are currently:
  
      :all
          :default
              :io
                  read
                  seek

          :system
              system
              exec
  
  
  Note that while the above category system is presently a strict
  hierarchy, this should not be assumed.
  
  A plain C<use autodie> implies C<use autodie qw(:default)>.  Note that
  C<system> and C<exec> are not enabled by default.  C<system> requires
  the optional L<IPC::System::Simple> module to be installed, and enabling
  C<system> or C<exec> will invalidate their exotic forms.  See L</BUGS>
  below for more details.
  
  The syntax:
  
      use autodie qw(:1.994);
  
  allows the C<:default> list from a particular version to be used.  This
  provides the convenience of using the default methods, but the surety
  that no behavioral changes will occur if the C<autodie> module is
  upgraded.
  
  C<autodie> can be enabled for all of Perl's built-ins, including
  C<system> and C<exec> with:
  
      use autodie qw(:all);
  
  =head1 FUNCTION SPECIFIC NOTES
  
  =head2 flock
  
  It is not considered an error for C<flock> to return false if it fails
  due to an C<EWOULDBLOCK> (or equivalent) condition.  This means one can
  still use the common convention of testing the return value of
  C<flock> when called with the C<LOCK_NB> option:
  
      use autodie;
  
      if ( flock($fh, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB) ) {
          # We have a lock
      }
  
  Autodying C<flock> will generate an exception if C<flock> returns
  false with any other error.
  
  =head2 system/exec
  
  The C<system> built-in is considered to have failed in the following
  circumstances:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  The command does not start.
  
  =item *
  
  The command is killed by a signal.
  
  =item *
  
  The command returns a non-zero exit value (but see below).
  
  =back
  
  On success, the autodying form of C<system> returns the I<exit value>
  rather than the contents of C<$?>.
  
  Additional allowable exit values can be supplied as an optional first
  argument to autodying C<system>:
  
      system( [ 0, 1, 2 ], $cmd, @args);  # 0,1,2 are good exit values
  
  C<autodie> uses the L<IPC::System::Simple> module to change C<system>.
  See its documentation for further information.
  
  Applying C<autodie> to C<system> or C<exec> causes the exotic
  forms C<system { $cmd } @args > or C<exec { $cmd } @args>
  to be considered a syntax error until the end of the lexical scope.
  If you really need to use the exotic form, you can call C<CORE::system>
  or C<CORE::exec> instead, or use C<no autodie qw(system exec)> before
  calling the exotic form.
  
  =head1 GOTCHAS
  
  Functions called in list context are assumed to have failed if they
  return an empty list, or a list consisting only of a single undef
  element.
  
  =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item :void cannot be used with lexical scope
  
  The C<:void> option is supported in L<Fatal>, but not
  C<autodie>.  To workaround this, C<autodie> may be explicitly disabled until
  the end of the current block with C<no autodie>.
  To disable autodie for only a single function (eg, open)
  use C<no autodie qw(open)>.
  
  C<autodie> performs no checking of called context to determine whether to throw
  an exception; the explicitness of error handling with C<autodie> is a deliberate
  feature.
  
  =item No user hints defined for %s
  
  You've insisted on hints for user-subroutines, either by pre-pending
  a C<!> to the subroutine name itself, or earlier in the list of arguments
  to C<autodie>.  However the subroutine in question does not have
  any hints available.
  
  =back
  
  See also L<Fatal/DIAGNOSTICS>.
  
  =head1 BUGS
  
  "Used only once" warnings can be generated when C<autodie> or C<Fatal>
  is used with package filehandles (eg, C<FILE>).  Scalar filehandles are
  strongly recommended instead.
  
  When using C<autodie> or C<Fatal> with user subroutines, the
  declaration of those subroutines must appear before the first use of
  C<Fatal> or C<autodie>, or have been exported from a module.
  Attempting to use C<Fatal> or C<autodie> on other user subroutines will
  result in a compile-time error.
  
  Due to a bug in Perl, C<autodie> may "lose" any format which has the
  same name as an autodying built-in or function.
  
  C<autodie> may not work correctly if used inside a file with a
  name that looks like a string eval, such as F<eval (3)>.
  
  =head2 autodie and string eval
  
  Due to the current implementation of C<autodie>, unexpected results
  may be seen when used near or with the string version of eval.
  I<None of these bugs exist when using block eval>.
  
  Under Perl 5.8 only, C<autodie> I<does not> propagate into string C<eval>
  statements, although it can be explicitly enabled inside a string
  C<eval>.
  
  Under Perl 5.10 only, using a string eval when C<autodie> is in
  effect can cause the autodie behaviour to leak into the surrounding
  scope.  This can be worked around by using a C<no autodie> at the
  end of the scope to explicitly remove autodie's effects, or by
  avoiding the use of string eval.
  
  I<None of these bugs exist when using block eval>.  The use of
  C<autodie> with block eval is considered good practice.

  =head1 NAME
  
  autodie::exception - Exceptions from autodying functions.
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      eval {
          use autodie;
  
          open(my $fh, '<', 'some_file.txt');
  
          ...
      };
  
      if (my $E = $@) {
          say "Ooops!  ",$E->caller," had problems: $@";
      }
  
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  When an L<autodie> enabled function fails, it generates an
  C<autodie::exception> object.  This can be interrogated to
  determine further information about the error that occurred.
  
  This document is broken into two sections; those methods that
  are most useful to the end-developer, and those methods for
  anyone wishing to subclass or get very familiar with
  C<autodie::exception>.
  
  =head2 Common Methods
  
  These methods are intended to be used in the everyday dealing
  of exceptions.
  
  The following assume that the error has been copied into
  a separate scalar:
  
      if ($E = $@) {
          ...
      }
  
  This is not required, but is recommended in case any code
  is called which may reset or alter C<$@>.
  
  =cut
  
  =head3 args
  
      my $array_ref = $E->args;
  
  Provides a reference to the arguments passed to the subroutine
  that died.
  
  =cut
  
  sub args        { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{args}; }
  
  =head3 function
  
      my $sub = $E->function;
  
  The subroutine (including package) that threw the exception.
  
  =cut
  
  sub function   { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{function};  }
  
  =head3 file
  
      my $file = $E->file;
  
  The file in which the error occurred (eg, C<myscript.pl> or
  C<MyTest.pm>).
  
  =cut
  
  sub file        { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{file};  }
  
  =head3 package
  
      my $package = $E->package;
  
  The package from which the exceptional subroutine was called.
  
  =cut
  
  sub package     { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{package}; }
  
  =head3 caller
  
      my $caller = $E->caller;
  
  The subroutine that I<called> the exceptional code.
  
  =cut
  
  sub caller      { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{caller};  }
  
  =head3 line
  
      my $line = $E->line;
  
  The line in C<< $E->file >> where the exceptional code was called.
  
  =cut
  
  sub line        { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{line};  }
  
  =head3 context
  
      my $context = $E->context;
  
  The context in which the subroutine was called by autodie; usually
  the same as the context in which you called the autodying subroutine.
  This can be 'list', 'scalar', or undefined (unknown).  It will never
  be 'void', as C<autodie> always captures the return value in one way
  or another.
  
  For some core functions that always return a scalar value regardless
  of their context (eg, C<chown>), this may be 'scalar', even if you
  used a list context.
  
  =cut
  
  # TODO: The comments above say this can be undefined. Is that actually
  # the case? (With 'system', perhaps?)
  
  sub context     { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{context} }
  
  =head3 return
  
      my $return_value = $E->return;
  
  The value(s) returned by the failed subroutine.  When the subroutine
  was called in a list context, this will always be a reference to an
  array containing the results.  When the subroutine was called in
  a scalar context, this will be the actual scalar returned.
  
  =cut
  
  sub return      { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{return} }
  
  =head3 errno
  
      my $errno = $E->errno;
  
  The value of C<$!> at the time when the exception occurred.
  
  B<NOTE>: This method will leave the main C<autodie::exception> class
  and become part of a role in the future.  You should only call
  C<errno> for exceptions where C<$!> would reasonably have been
  set on failure.
  
  =cut
  
  # TODO: Make errno part of a role.  It doesn't make sense for
  # everything.
  
  sub errno       { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{errno}; }
  
  =head3 eval_error
  
      my $old_eval_error = $E->eval_error;
  
  The contents of C<$@> immediately after autodie triggered an
  exception.  This may be useful when dealing with modules such
  as L<Text::Balanced> that set (but do not throw) C<$@> on error.
  
  =cut
  
  sub eval_error { return $_[0]->{$PACKAGE}{eval_error}; }
  
  =head3 matches
  
      if ( $e->matches('open') ) { ... }
  
      if ( $e ~~ 'open' ) { ... }
  
  C<matches> is used to determine whether a
  given exception matches a particular role.  On Perl 5.10,
  using smart-match (C<~~>) with an C<autodie::exception> object
  will use C<matches> underneath.
  
  An exception is considered to match a string if:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  For a string not starting with a colon, the string exactly matches the
  package and subroutine that threw the exception.  For example,
  C<MyModule::log>.  If the string does not contain a package name,
  C<CORE::> is assumed.
  
  =item *
  
  For a string that does start with a colon, if the subroutine
  throwing the exception I<does> that behaviour.  For example, the
  C<CORE::open> subroutine does C<:file>, C<:io> and C<:all>.
  
  See L<autodie/CATEGORIES> for further information.

      sub matches {

          return 1 if $that eq $sub;
          return 1 if $that !~ /:/ and "CORE::$that" eq $sub;

  The C<register> method allows for the registration of a message

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  =head2 Introduction
  
  The L<autodie> pragma is very smart when it comes to working with
  Perl's built-in functions.  The behaviour for these functions are
  fixed, and C<autodie> knows exactly how they try to signal failure.
  
  But what about user-defined subroutines from modules?  If you use
  C<autodie> on a user-defined subroutine then it assumes the following
  behaviour to demonstrate failure:
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  A false value, in scalar context
  
  =item * 
  
  An empty list, in list context
  
  =item *
  
  A list containing a single undef, in list context
  
  =back
  
  All other return values (including the list of the single zero, and the
  list containing a single empty string) are considered successful.  However,
  real-world code isn't always that easy.  Perhaps the code you're working
  with returns a string containing the word "FAIL" upon failure, or a
  two element list containing C<(undef, "human error message")>.  To make
  autodie work with these sorts of subroutines, we have
  the I<hinting interface>.
  
  The hinting interface allows I<hints> to be provided to C<autodie>
  on how it should detect failure from user-defined subroutines.  While
  these I<can> be provided by the end-user of C<autodie>, they are ideally
  written into the module itself, or into a helper module or sub-class
  of C<autodie> itself.
  
  =head2 What are hints?
  
  A I<hint> is a subroutine or value that is checked against the
  return value of an autodying subroutine.  If the match returns true,
  C<autodie> considers the subroutine to have failed.
  
  If the hint provided is a subroutine, then C<autodie> will pass
  the complete return value to that subroutine.  If the hint is
  any other value, then C<autodie> will smart-match against the
  value provided.  In Perl 5.8.x there is no smart-match operator, and as such
  only subroutine hints are supported in these versions.
  
  Hints can be provided for both scalar and list contexts.  Note
  that an autodying subroutine will never see a void context, as
  C<autodie> always needs to capture the return value for examination.
  Autodying subroutines called in void context act as if they're called
  in a scalar context, but their return value is discarded after it
  has been checked.
  
  =head2 Example hints
  
  Hints may consist of scalars, array references, regular expressions and
  subroutine references.  You can specify different hints for how
  failure should be identified in scalar and list contexts.
  
  These examples apply for use in the C<AUTODIE_HINTS> subroutine and when
  calling C<autodie::hints->set_hints_for()>.
  
  The most common context-specific hints are:
  
          # Scalar failures always return undef:
              {  scalar => undef  }
  
          # Scalar failures return any false value [default expectation]:
              {  scalar => sub { ! $_[0] }  }
  
          # Scalar failures always return zero explicitly:
              {  scalar => '0'  }
  
          # List failures always return an empty list:
              {  list => []  }
  
          # List failures return () or (undef) [default expectation]:
              {  list => sub { ! @_ || @_ == 1 && !defined $_[0] }  }
  
          # List failures return () or a single false value:
              {  list => sub { ! @_ || @_ == 1 && !$_[0] }  }
  
          # List failures return (undef, "some string")
              {  list => sub { @_ == 2 && !defined $_[0] }  }
  
          # Unsuccessful foo() returns 'FAIL' or '_FAIL' in scalar context,
          #                    returns (-1) in list context...
          autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
              \&foo,
              {
                  scalar => qr/^ _? FAIL $/xms,
                  list   => [-1],
              }
          );
  
          # Unsuccessful foo() returns 0 in all contexts...
          autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
              \&foo,
              {
                  scalar => 0,
                  list   => [0],
              }
          );
  
  This "in all contexts" construction is very common, and can be
  abbreviated, using the 'fail' key.  This sets both the C<scalar>
  and C<list> hints to the same value:
  
          # Unsuccessful foo() returns 0 in all contexts...
          autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
              \&foo,
              {
                  fail => sub { @_ == 1 and defined $_[0] and $_[0] == 0 }
              }
  	);
  
          # Unsuccessful think_positive() returns negative number on failure...
          autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
              \&think_positive,
              {
                  fail => sub { $_[0] < 0 }
              }
  	);
  
          # Unsuccessful my_system() returns non-zero on failure...
          autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
              \&my_system,
              {
                  fail => sub { $_[0] != 0 }
              }
  	);
  
  =head1 Manually setting hints from within your program
  
  If you are using a module which returns something special on failure, then
  you can manually create hints for each of the desired subroutines.  Once
  the hints are specified, they are available for all files and modules loaded
  thereafter, thus you can move this work into a module and it will still
  work.
  
  	use Some::Module qw(foo bar);
  	use autodie::hints;
  
  	autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
  		\&foo,
  		{
  			scalar => SCALAR_HINT,
  			list   => LIST_HINT,
  		}
  	);
  	autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
  		\&bar,
                  { fail => SOME_HINT, }
  	);
  
  It is possible to pass either a subroutine reference (recommended) or a fully
  qualified subroutine name as the first argument.  This means you can set hints
  on modules that I<might> get loaded:
  
  	use autodie::hints;
  	autodie::hints->set_hints_for(
  		'Some::Module:bar', { fail => SCALAR_HINT, }
  	);
  
  This technique is most useful when you have a project that uses a
  lot of third-party modules.  You can define all your possible hints
  in one-place.  This can even be in a sub-class of autodie.  For
  example:
  
          package my::autodie;
  
          use parent qw(autodie);
          use autodie::hints;
  
          autodie::hints->set_hints_for(...);
  
          1;
  
  You can now C<use my::autodie>, which will work just like the standard
  C<autodie>, but is now aware of any hints that you've set.
  
  =head1 Adding hints to your module
  
  C<autodie> provides a passive interface to allow you to declare hints for
  your module.  These hints will be found and used by C<autodie> if it
  is loaded, but otherwise have no effect (or dependencies) without autodie.
  To set these, your module needs to declare that it I<does> the
  C<autodie::hints::provider> role.  This can be done by writing your
  own C<DOES> method, using a system such as C<Class::DOES> to handle
  the heavy-lifting for you, or declaring a C<%DOES> package variable
  with a C<autodie::hints::provider> key and a corresponding true value.
  
  Note that checking for a C<%DOES> hash is an C<autodie>-only
  short-cut.  Other modules do not use this mechanism for checking
  roles, although you can use the C<Class::DOES> module from the
  CPAN to allow it.
  
  In addition, you must define a C<AUTODIE_HINTS> subroutine that returns
  a hash-reference containing the hints for your subroutines:
  
          package Your::Module;
  
          # We can use the Class::DOES from the CPAN to declare adherence
          # to a role.
  
          use Class::DOES 'autodie::hints::provider' => 1;
  
          # Alternatively, we can declare the role in %DOES.  Note that
          # this is an autodie specific optimisation, although Class::DOES
          # can be used to promote this to a true role declaration.
  
          our %DOES = ( 'autodie::hints::provider' => 1 );
  
          # Finally, we must define the hints themselves.
  
  	sub AUTODIE_HINTS {
  	    return {
  	        foo => { scalar => HINTS, list => SOME_HINTS },
  	        bar => { scalar => HINTS, list => MORE_HINTS },
  	        baz => { fail => HINTS },
  	    }
  	}
  
  This allows your code to set hints without relying on C<autodie> and
  C<autodie::hints> being loaded, or even installed.  In this way your
  code can do the right thing when C<autodie> is installed, but does not
  need to depend upon it to function.
  
  =head1 Insisting on hints
  
  When a user-defined subroutine is wrapped by C<autodie>, it will
  use hints if they are available, and otherwise reverts to the
  I<default behaviour> described in the introduction of this document.
  This can be problematic if we expect a hint to exist, but (for
  whatever reason) it has not been loaded.
  
  We can ask autodie to I<insist> that a hint be used by prefixing
  an exclamation mark to the start of the subroutine name.  A lone
  exclamation mark indicates that I<all> subroutines after it must
  have hints declared.
  
  	# foo() and bar() must have their hints defined
  	use autodie qw( !foo !bar baz );
  
  	# Everything must have hints (recommended).
  	use autodie qw( ! foo bar baz );
  
  	# bar() and baz() must have their hints defined
  	use autodie qw( foo ! bar baz );
  
          # Enable autodie for all of Perl's supported built-ins,
          # as well as for foo(), bar() and baz().  Everything must
          # have hints.
          use autodie qw( ! :all foo bar baz );
  
  If hints are not available for the specified subroutines, this will cause a
  compile-time error.  Insisting on hints for Perl's built-in functions
  (eg, C<open> and C<close>) is always successful.
  
  Insisting on hints is I<strongly> recommended.

  =item Attempts to set_hints_for unidentifiable subroutine
  
  You've called C<< autodie::hints->set_hints_for() >> using a subroutine
  reference, but that reference could not be resolved back to a
  subroutine name.  It may be an anonymous subroutine (which can't
  be made autodying), or may lack a name for other reasons.
  
  If you receive this error with a subroutine that has a real name,
  then you may have found a bug in autodie.  See L<autodie/BUGS>
  for how to report this.
  
  =item fail hints cannot be provided with either scalar or list hints for %s
  
  When defining hints, you can either supply both C<list> and
  C<scalar> keywords, I<or> you can provide a single C<fail> keyword.
  You can't mix and match them.
  
  =item %s hint missing for %s
  
  You've provided either a C<scalar> hint without supplying
  a C<list> hint, or vice-versa.  You I<must> supply both C<scalar>
  and C<list> hints, I<or> a single C<fail> hint.

  This dummy class exists to signal that the class inheriting it should
  be skipped when reporting exceptions from autodie.  This is useful
  for utility classes like L<Path::Tiny> that wish to report the location
  of where they were called on failure.
  
  If your class has a better way of doing roles, then you should not
  load this class and instead simply say that your class I<DOES>
  C<autodie::skip> instead.
